212,Spike protein binding prediction with neutralizing antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 1 2,"abstractcoronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a new emerging human infectious disease caused by severe acute 24 respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2, also previously known as 2019-ncov), originated in 25 wuhan seafood and animal market, china. since december 2019, more than 69,000 cases of covid-19 have 26 been confirmed in china and quickly spreads to other counties. currently, researchers put their best efforts to 27 identify effective drugs for covid-19. the neutralizing antibody, which binds to viral capsid in a manner that 28 inhibits cellular entry of virus and uncoating of the genome, is the specific defense against viral invaders. in this 29 study, we investigate to identify neutralizing antibodies that can bind to sars-cov-2 sipke (s) protein and 30 interfere with the interaction between viral s protein and a host receptor by bioinformatic methods. the 31 sequence analysis of s protein showed two major differences in the rbd region of the sars-cov-2 s protein 32 compared to sars-cov and sars-cov related bat viruses (btsars-cov). the insertion regions were close to 33 interacting residues with the human ace2 receptor. epitope analysis of neutralizing antibodies revealed that 34 sars-cov neutralizing antibodies used conformational epitopes, whereas mers-cov neutralizing antibodies 35 used a common linear epitope region, which contributes to form the β-sheet structure in mers-cov s protein 36 and deleted in sars-cov-2 s protein. to identify effective neutralizing antibodies for sars-cov-2, the 37 binding affinities of neutralizing antibodies with sars-cov-2 s protein were predicted and compared by 38 antibody-antigen docking simulation. the result showed that cr3022 neutralizing antibody from human may 39 have higher binding affinity with sars-cov-2 s protein than sars-cov s protein. we also found that 40 f26g19 and d12 mouse antibodies could bind to sars-cov s protein with high affinity. our findings provide 41 crucial clues towards the development of antigen diagnosis, therapeutic antibody, and the vaccine against sars-42 cov-2. 43 44 45"," Republic,  Korea"
51,COVID-19 Vaccine Candidates: Prediction and Validation of 174 SARS-CoV-2 Epitopes,"abstractthe recent outbreak of sars-cov-2 (2019-ncov) virus has highlighted the need for fast and efficacious vaccine development. stimulation of a proper immune response that leads to protection is highly dependent on presentation of epitopes to circulating t-cells via the hla complex. sars-cov-2 is a large rna virus and testing of all overlapping peptides in vitro to deconvolute an immune response is not feasible. therefore hla-binding prediction tools are often used to narrow down the number of peptides to test. we tested 15 epitope-hla-binding prediction tools, and using an in vitro peptide mhc stability assay, we assessed 777 peptides that were predicted to be good binders across 11 mhc allotypes. in this investigation of potential sars-cov-2 epitopes we found that current prediction tools vary in performance when assessing binding stability, and they are highly dependent on the mhc allotype in question. designing a covid-19 vaccine where only a few epitope targets are included is therefore a very challenging task. here, we present 174 sars-cov-2 epitopes with high prediction binding scores, validated to bind stably to 11 hla allotypes. our findings may contribute to the design of an efficacious vaccine against covid-19.","Marek Prachar, Sune Justesen, Daniel Bisgaard Steen-Jensen, Stephan Thorgrimsen, Erik Jurgons, Ole Winther, Frederik Otzen Bagger"

149,A B,"abstractthe spread of the novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2) has triggered a global emergency, that demands urgent solutions for detection and therapy to prevent escalating health, social and economic impacts. the spike protein (s) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ace2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells 1 . the s proteins from sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 are similar 2 , but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (rbd) preclude the use of sars-cov-1-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit sars-cov-2 3 . here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced betacoronaviruses to reveal that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein e shows a variant shared by sars and sars-cov2 with two completely-conserved key functional features, an ion-channel and a pdz-binding motif (pbm). these features trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) 4-6 , the leading cause of death in sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 infection 7,8 . however, three drugs approved for human use may inhibit sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 protein e, either acting upon the ion channel (amantadine and hexamethylene amiloride 9,10 ) or the pbm (sb203580 5 ), thereby potentially increasing the survival of the host, as already demonstrated for sars-cov-1in animal models. hence, blocking the sars protein e inhibits development of ards in vivo. given that our results demonstrate that the protein e subcluster for the sars clade is quasi-identical for the key functional regions of sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2, we conclude that use of approved drugs shown to act as sars e protein inhibitors can help prevent further casualties from covid-2019 while vaccines and other preventive measures are being developed.","Intikhab Alam, Allan Kamau, Maxat Kulmanov, Stefan T Arold, Arnab Pain, Takashi Gojobori, Carlos M Duarte,  Clade"

559,Comparative genomic analysis revealed specific mutation pattern between human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13,"abstractthe novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 (2019-ncov) is a member of the family coronaviridae and contains a single-stranded rna genome with positive-polarity. to reveal the evolution mechanism of sars-cov-2 genome, we performed comprehensive genomic analysis with newly sequenced sars-cov-2 strains and 20 closely related coronavirus strains. among 98 nucleotide mutations at 93 sites of the genome among different sars-cov-2 strains, 58 of them caused amino acid change, indicating a result of neutral evolution. however, the ratio of nucleotide substitutions to amino acid substitutions of spike gene (9.07) between sars-cov-2 wiv04 and bat-sarsr-cov ratg13 was extensively higher than those from comparisons between other coronaviruses (range 1.29 -4.81). the elevated synonymous mutations between sars-cov-2 and ratg13, suggesting they underwent stronger purifying selection. moreover, their nucleotide substitutions are enriched with t:c transition, which is consistent with the mutation signature caused by deactivity of rna 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (exon). the codon usage was similar between sars-cov-2 and other strains in beta-coronavirus lineage b, suggesting it had small impact on the mutation pattern. in comparison of sars-cov-2 wiv04 with bat-sarsr-cov ratg13, the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dn/ds) was the lowest among all performed comparisons, reconfirming the evolution of sars-cov-2 under stringent selective pressure. moreover, some sites of spike protein might be subjected to positive selection. therefore, our results will help understanding the evolutionary mechanisms contribute to viral pathogenicity and its adaptation with hosts.","Longxian Lv, Gaolei Li, Jinhui Chen, Xinle Liang, Yudong Li"

coronavirus disease caused by sars-cov-2 31 infection in wuhan, china has posed a serious threat to global public health. to 32 develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular 33 mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be confirmed. therefore, we herein 34 used a sars-cov-2 spike (s) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that 35 sars-cov-2 showed plasma membrane fusion capacity superior to that of 36 sars-cov. we solved the x-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-hb) core 37 of the hr1 and hr2 domains in sars-cov-2 s protein s2 subunit, revealing that 38 several mutated amino acid residues in the hr1 domain may be associated with 39 enhanced interactions with hr2 domain. we previously developed a pan-coronavirus 40 fusion inhibitor, ek1, which targeted hr1 domain and could inhibit infection by 41 divergent human coronaviruses tested, including sars-cov and mers-cov. we 42 then generated a series of lipopeptides and found that the ek1c4 was the most potent 43 fusion inhibitor against sars-cov-2 s protein-mediated membrane fusion and 44 pseudovirus infection with ic 50 s of 1.3 and 15.8 nm, about 241-and 149-fold more 45 potent than that of ek1 peptide, respectively. ek1c4 was also highly effective 46 against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses 47 tested, including sars-cov and mers-cov, as well as sarsr-covs, potently 48 inhibiting replication of 4 live human coronaviruses, including sars-cov-2. 49 intranasal application of ek1c4 before or after challenge with hcov-oc43 protected 50 mice from infection, suggesting that ek1c4 could be used for prevention and 51 treatment of infection by currently circulating sars-cov-2 and emerging 52 sarsr-covs. 53 including 2,618 deaths, were reported in china and 27 other countries 11 , posing a 70 serious threat to global public health and thus calling for the prompt development of 71 specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics for treatment and prevention 72 of covid-19. 73 coronaviruses (covs), the largest rna viruses identified so far, belonging to the 74 coronaviridae family, are divided into 4 genera, α-, β-, δ-and γ-coronaviruses, while 75 the β-coronaviruses are further divided into a, b, c, and d lineages. the seven covs 76 that can infect humans (hcovs) include hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 in the 77 α-coronaviruses, hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 in the β-coronaviruses lineage a, 78 sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in the β-coronaviruses lineage b (β-b coronaviruses), 79 and mers-cov in the β-coronaviruses lineage c 6 . to develop specific sars-cov-2 80 fusion inhibitors, it is essential to study the fusion capacity of sars-cov-2 compared 81 to that of sars-cov. particularly, the spike (s) protein s2 subunit of sars-cov-2, we have solved the x-ray crystal structure of sars-cov-2's 6-hb core and 111 identified several mutated amino acid residues in hr1 domain responsible for its 112 enhanced interactions with hr2 domain. by conjugating the cholesterol molecule to 113 the ek1 peptide, we found that one of the lipopeptides, ek1c4, exhibited highly 114 potent inhibitory activity against sars-cov-2 s-mediated membrane fusion and psv 115 infection, about 240-and 150-fold more potent than ek1 peptide, respectively. 116 ek1c4 is also highly effective against in vitro and in vivo infection of some live 117 hcovs, such as sars-cov-2, hcov-oc43 and mers-cov, suggesting potential for 118 further development as pan-cov fusion inhibitor-based therapeutics and prophylactics 119 for treatment and prevention of infection by the currently circulating sars-cov-2 120 and mers-cov, as well as future reemerging sars-cov and emerging 121 sarsr-covs. 122 results 123 the capacity of sars-cov-2 s protein-mediated membrane fusion 124 from the gisaid platform ( we obtained the 125 full-length amino-acid sequence of sars-cov-2 (betacov 2019-2020) s protein 126 (genbank: qhd43416). through alignment with sars-cov and sl-covs s 127 proteins, we located the functional domains in sars-cov-2 s protein, which 128 contains s1 subunit and s2 subunit with the cleavage site at r685/s686 15 . s1 subunit 129 is located within the n-terminal 14-685 amino acids of s protein, containing 130 n-terminal domain (ntd), receptor binding domain (rbd), and receptor binding 131 motif (rbm). s2

994,SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to type I interferon pretreatment,"abstractarticle summary: sars-cov-2 has similar replication kinetics to sars-cov, but demonstrates significant sensitivity to type i interferon treatment.abstract 1 sars-cov-2, a novel coronavirus (cov), has recently emerged causing an ongoing outbreak of 2 viral pneumonia around the world. while genetically distinct from the original sars-cov, both 3 group 2b covs share similar genome organization and origins to coronaviruses harbored in 4 bats. importantly, initial guidance has used insights from sars-cov infection to inform 5 treatment and public health strategies. in this report, we evaluate type-i interferon (ifn-i) 6sensitivity of sars-cov-2 relative to the original sars-cov. our results indicate that while 7 sars-cov-2 maintains similar viral replication kinetics to sars-cov in vero cell, the novel 8cov is much more sensitive to ifn-i pretreatment. examining transcriptional factor activation 9 and interferon stimulated gene (isg) induction, sars-cov-2 in the context of type i ifn 10 induces phosphorylation of stat1 and increased isg proteins. in contrast, the original sars-11cov has no evidence for stat1 phosphorylation or isg protein increases even in the presence 12 of type i ifn pretreatment. finally, we examined homology between sars-cov and sars-13cov-2 in viral proteins shown to be interferon antagonist. the absence of open reading frame 14 (orf) 3b and significant changes to orf6 suggest the two key ifn antagonists may not 15 maintain equivalent function in sars-cov-2. together, the results identify key differences in 16 susceptibility to the ifn-i response between sars-cov and sars-cov-2. that could help 17 inform disease progression, treatment options, and animal model development. 18with the ongoing outbreak of covid-19 disease, differences between the sars-cov-2 and the 20 original sars-cov could be leveraged to inform disease progression and eventual treatment 21options. in addition, these findings could have key implications for animal model development 22as well as further research into how sars-cov-2 modulates the type i ifn response early 23 during infection.","Kumari G Lokugamage, Adam Hage, Craig Schindewolf, Ricardo Rajsbaum, Vineet D Menachery"
11031,"viruses Perspective Potential Maternal and Infant Outcomes from Coronavirus 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) Infecting Pregnant Women: Lessons from SARS, MERS, and Other Human Coronavirus Infections","abstractin early december 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the people's republic of china. further investigation revealed these cases to result from infection with a newly identified coronavirus, initially termed 2019-ncov and subsequently sars-cov-2. the infection moved rapidly through china, spread to thailand and japan, extended into adjacent countries through infected persons travelling by air, eventually reaching multiple countries and continents. similar to such other coronaviruses as those causing the middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), the new coronavirus was reported to spread via natural aerosols from human-to-human. in the early stages of this epidemic the case fatality rate is estimated to be approximately 2%, with the majority of deaths occurring in special populations. unfortunately, there is limited experience with coronavirus infections during pregnancy, and it now appears certain that pregnant women have become infected during the present 2019-ncov epidemic. in order to assess the potential of the wuhan 2019-ncov to cause maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity and other poor obstetrical outcomes, this communication reviews the published data addressing the epidemiological and clinical effects of sars, mers, and other coronavirus infections on pregnant women and their infants. recommendations are also made for the consideration of pregnant women in the design, clinical trials, and implementation of future 2019-ncov vaccines.viruses 2020, 12, 194 2 of 16 tract infections. both the sars-cov and mers-cov have several features in common that are factors in producing nosocomial transmission, replication in the lower respiratory tract, and viral immunopathology. both coronaviruses are zoonotic infections and constitute significant public health threats that have resulted in epidemics with significant loss of life  5, 6] . when the sars-cov and mers-cov infect women who are pregnant, they can result in poor obstetric outcomes including maternal morbidity and death. there are currently no vaccines or specific treatments approved for coronavirus infections  6] .prior to december 2019, there were a total of six coronavirus species that produced human infection: hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 belonging to the alphacoronavirus genus; and hcov-oc43, hcov-hku1, mers-cov, and sars-cov, which belong to the betacoronavirus genus . as of december 2019, there are now seven species that infect humans.as the newly identified novel coronavirus, termed 2019-ncov and subsequently named sars-cov-2, spreads rapidly throughout china and across to other countries, researchers scramble to understand transmission dynamics, virulence, and pathogenicity. given the rapidly progressive spread of this current 2019 novel coronavirus it is reasonable to expect that pregnant women have already become infected. the effect of 2019-ncov during pregnancy is, at the present, unknown. this communication reviews the medical and clinical findings from coronavirus infections in pregnant women in order to anticipate how the newly discovered 2019-ncov might affect maternal and infant morbidity and mortality.funding: this research received no external funding.the authors declare no conflict of interest.","David A Schwartz, Ashley L Graham"
860,Projecting the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 through the post-pandemic period,"abstractthere is an urgent need to project how transmission of the novel betacoronavirus sars-cov-2 will unfold in coming years. these dynamics will depend on seasonality, the duration of immunity, and the strength of cross-immunity to/from the other human coronaviruses. using data from the united states, we measured how these factors affect transmission of human betacoronaviruses hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1. we then built a mathematical model to simulate transmission of sars-cov-2 through the year 2025. we project that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of sars-cov-2 will probably occur after an initial pandemic wave. we summarize the full range of plausible transmission scenarios and identify key data still needed to distinguish between them, most importantly longitudinal serological studies to determine the duration of immunity to sars-cov-2.main text. the ongoing sars-cov-2 epidemic has caused nearly 80,000 detected cases of covid-19 illness and claimed over 2,500 lives as of 24 feb 2020 (1). with sustained transmission reported in china, japan, iran, italy, and south korea (1), the outbreak is on the verge of becoming a pandemic. the required intensity, duration, and urgency of public health responses will depend on how the initial pandemic wave unfolds and on the subsequent transmission dynamics of sars-cov-2. one possibility is that sars-cov-2 will follow its closest genetic relative, sars-cov, and be eradicated by intensive public health measures after causing a brief but intense epidemic (2). increasingly, public health authorities consider this scenario unlikely (3). alternatively, the transmission of sars-cov-2 could resemble that of pandemic influenza by circulating seasonally after causing an initial global wave of infection (4).such a scenario could reflect the previous emergence of known human coronaviruses from zoonotic origins e.g. human coronavirus (hcov) oc43 (5). this paper identifies viral, environmental, and immunologic factors which in combination will determine which scenarios in fact play out, and identifies key data needed to distinguish between them.the transmission dynamics of the sars-cov-2 epidemic will depend on factors including the degree of seasonal variation in transmission strength, the duration of immunity, and the degree of cross-immunity between sars-cov-2 and other coronaviruses. sars-cov-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus, which includes the sars coronavirus, mers coronavirus, and two other human coronaviruses, hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1. the sars and mers coronaviruses cause severe illness with case fatality rates of 9 and 36% respectively, but the transmission of both has remained limited (6). hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 infections may be asymptomatic or associated with mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness; these hcovs are considered the second most common cause of the common cold (6). while investigations into the spectrum of illness caused by sars-cov-2 are ongoing, recent evidence indicates the majority of cases experience mild illness with more limited occurrence of severe lower respiratory infection (7). current covid-19 case fatality rates in china are estimated at 2.9% within hubei province, and 0.4% outside (8), suggesting lower severity than sars and mers but higher severity than hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1. in terms of transmission, the ability of sars-cov-2 to cause widespread infection is more reflective of hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 than of its more clinically severe relatives. hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 cause annual wintertime outbreaks of respiratory illness in temperate regions (9, 10), suggesting that wintertime climate and host behaviors may facilitate transmission, as is true for influenza (11) (12) (13) . immunity to hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 appears to wane appreciably within one year (14), while sars infection can induce longer-lasting immunity (15). the . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) the copyright holder for this preprint .","Stephen M Kissler, † , Christine Tedijanto, Edward M Goldstein, Yonatan H Grad, Marc Lipsitch"

449,The SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome The architecture of SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome The SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome,"abstractsars-cov-2 is a betacoronavirus that is responsible for the covid-19 2 pandemic. the genome of sars-cov-2 was reported recently, but its 3 transcriptomic architecture is unknown. utilizing two complementary 4 sequencing techniques, we here present a high-resolution map of the 5 sars-cov-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome. dna nanoball sequencing 6 shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous 7 recombination events, both canonical and noncanonical. in addition to the 8 genomic rna and subgenomic rnas common in all coronaviruses, 9 sars-cov-2 produces a large number of transcripts encoding unknown orfs 10 with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift. using nanopore direct rna 11 sequencing, we further find at least 41 rna modification sites on viral 12 transcripts, with the most frequent motif being aagaa. modified rnas have 13 shorter poly(a) tails than unmodified rnas, suggesting a link between the 14 internal modification and the 3 ′ tail. functional investigation of the unknown 15 orfs and rna modifications discovered in this study will open new directions 16 to our understanding of the life cycle and pathogenicity of sars-cov-2. 17 kim et al. highlights 21 • we provide a high-resolution map of sars-cov-2 transcriptome and 22 epitranscriptome using nanopore direct rna sequencing and dna 23 nanoball sequencing. 24 • the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous recombination 25 events, both canonical and noncanonical. 26 • in addition to the genomic and subgenomic rnas common in all 27 coronaviruses, sars-cov-2 produces transcripts encoding unknown 28 orfs. 29 • we discover at least 41 potential rna modification sites with an aagaa 30 motif. 31 kim et al. designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) 34 (zhou et al., 2020; zhu et al., 2020). like other coronaviruses (order nidovirales, 35 family coronaviridae, subfamily coronavirinae), sars-cov-2 is an enveloped 36 virus with a positive-sense, single-stranded rna genome of~30 kb. 37 sars-cov-2 belongs to the genus betacoronavirus, together with sars-cov 38 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) (with 80% and 39 50% homology, respectively) (kim et al., 2020; zhou et al., 2020). coronaviruses 40 (covs) were thought to primarily cause enzootic infections in birds and 41 mammals. but, the recurring outbreaks of sars, mers, and now covid-19 42 have clearly demonstrated the remarkable ability of covs to cross species 43 barriers and transmit between humans (menachery et al., 2017). 44 covs carry the largest genomes (26-32 kb) among all rna virus families 45 (figure 1). each viral transcript has a 5 ′ -cap structure and a 3 ′ poly(a) tail (lai 46 and stohlman, 1981; yogo et al., 1977). upon cell entry, the genomic rna is 47 translated to produce nonstructural proteins (nsps) from two open reading 48 frames (orfs), orf1a, and orf1b. the orf1a produces polypeptide 1a (pp1a, 49 440-500 kda) that is cleaved into 11 nsps. the −1 ribosome frameshift occurs 50 immediately upstream of the orf1a stop codon, which allows continued 51 translation of orf1b, yielding a large polypeptide (pp1ab, 740-810 kda) which 52 is cleaved into 16 nsps. the proteolytic cleavage is mediated by viral proteases 53 nsp3 and nsp5 that harbor a papain-like protease domain and a 3c-like protease 54 domain, respectively.55the viral genome is also used as the template for replication and 56 transcription, which is mediated by nsp12 harboring rna-dependent rna 57 polymerase (rdrp) activity (snijder et al., 2016; sola et al., 2015) . 58 negative-strand rna intermediates are generated to serve as the templates for 59 the synthesis of positive-sense genomic rna (grna) and subgenomic rnas 60 (sgrnas). the grna is packaged by the structural proteins to assemble progeny 61 virions. shorter sgrnas encode conserved structural proteins (spike protein (s), 62 kim et al.","Dongwan Kim, Joo-Yeon Lee, Jeong-Sun Yang, Jun Won Kim, V Narry Kim, Hyeshik Chang"

more than 82% identical to those of sars-cov and bat sars-like coronavirus (sl-cov) 12 . on the basis of analysis of this complete genomes obtained in this study, several laboratories developed molecular detection tools based on targeting orf1ab, rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) gene n, and e regions of viral spike genes  . and then the rapid identification of this novel coronavirus is attributed to recent advances in the detection of sars-cov-2, including rt-pcr, real-time reverse transcription pcr (rrt-pcr), reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (rt-lamp), and microarray-based assays. at present, rt-pcr is a widely used detection technique for sars-cov-2 and several marketed nucleic acid detection kits for using in clinic 14 . currently, the standard of reference for the covid-19 pneumonia diagnosis is a positive result in nucleic acid detection assay for the upper and lower respiratory tract specimens and blood, respiratory tract specimens were including nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. and the patients confirmed with the covid-19 pneumonia had 2 or 3 continuous negative rt-pcr results for nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens can discharge from hospital. however, the scholar around china indicated that cases of covid-19 that had 2 or 3 continuous negative rt-pcr results for

independent sample t-test and one-sample t-test were utilized to compare significant differences among continuous data. statistical analysis of agreement was performed using mcnemar chi-squared test. it was regarded as statistical significance when the value was less than 0.05. we used r (version 3.5.0) for all analyses.resultsthe patients involved in this study summed 568, including 87 covid-19 and 481 non-covid19.all of them were the local residents of wuhan, had a recent travel to wuhan or contacted with people from wuhan. and they were all eligible for the epidemiology criteria of suspected cases, and received further medical isolation, examination and diagnosis. among the patients, 58.2% were males.throughout the whole spectrum of age, 15-59 years group generates 60.6% of all populations in this study, and 5.7% of patients were aged below 15 years (table 1 ). in the disease severity, 83.9% (73 of 87 patients) were mild and 16.1% (14 of 87 patients)were severe.in the early stage of covid outbreak, rt-pcr and ct scan were the main measure for screening sars-cov-2 infection. hence we collected the results of the two methods in the 568patints in further.in the period of jan 17 th to feb 11 th , total 1674 specimen from the 568 patients were detected by rt-pcr, which included 1415 pharyngeal and 259 stool (table1). all patients after being admission received at least one rt-pcr detection for pharyngeal swabs, and 341 patients were subjected to the second rtpcr test for pharyngeal swabs. the stool detected by rt-pcr accounted to 259, 81 of which were from covid-19

first rt-pcr and second rt-pcr for pharyngeal and 341 being subjected to ct scan were analyzed. the performance indexes were shown in table1. the results showed that the sensitivity of rt-pcr in parallel with ct scan was the highest( 91.9%), which was higher than that of parallel with second nucleic acid (86.2%) (table1).but the specificity of two nucleic acid detections was significantly higher than that of combination of nucleic acid and ct, suggesting that nucleic acid in parallel with ct was more appropriate to screen sars-cov-22 infections, and two nucleic acid tests for exclusion diagnosis maybe more suitable.it is reported that alive virus can survive in stool of covid-19 patients. according our data, 8.6% patients (table1) cannot be identified by combination of rt-pcr for pharyngeal swab and ct scan.since that, can the rt-pcr test for stool be an efficiency assisting examination? in this study, there were 75 covid-19 cases subjecting to stool nucleotide detection. therefore, all of the rt-pcr results from 75 case with stool nucleotide detection were plotted along time axis (figure3) . it was demonstrated that 35 cases had at least one positive results and the discovery rate is 46.7%. the stool presented earlier positive than the throat swab in two cases (patient no. 21, 38) (figure3) . moreover, pharyngeal swab of no.21 patient had been always negative until the end of the study. there were 16 patients with remaining positive results of stool after two consecutive negative results of pharyngeal swabs ( patient no.2,8,13,15,18,21,24,26,27,29,30,35,39,40,42,48) during their hospitalization (figure3). importantly, of the 14 discharged patients, two cases had stools being negative later than pharyngeal swabs (patient no.2,10) (figure3). the data above suggested that the detection of fecal nucleic acid could be employed to improve the discovery rate and might be developed as an indicator of monitoring and

case of a public health emergency, proficient diagnostic laboratories can rely on this robust technology to establish new diagnostic tests within their routine services before pre-formulated assays become available.in our study, the sensitivity of rt-pcr was greater than that other reports (78% vs 30%-50%) in the first assay. the reasons for the high sensitivity of our series may include 26,27 : the first was samples, in some hospital, the patients' nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs were collected for testing the sars-cov-2 separately. in our study, the detection specimen was the patient's pharyngeal and nasal swabs combine, compared to the pharyngeal or nasal swab only , indicating higher sensitivity at initial screening. we show that the strategy for the detection of viral rna in pharyngeal and nasal swabs used for sars-cov-2 diagnosis is not perfect. we also found that the virus are present in several stool swabs of patients when pharyngeal and nasal swabs detection negative. based on the infected patients can potentially shed this pathogen through respiratory and fecal-oral routes, we applied test for oral and stool swabs which could greatly improved detection positive rate.among the 87 laboratory-confirmed cases, there were still 19 cases with rt-pcr results testing negative in the first assay. in the false negatives can be caused by poor sample quality, such as respiratory tract samples collected from the oropharynx; collection that is too early or late in the progression of the disease, in the early stages, the number of viruses in the body is not

which is prone to death and degradation. in the process of collecting samples and transporting them to the laboratory for testing, it takes a long time and the nucleic acid is easy to degrade, so it is not easy to detect positive. at last, technical factors, including virus mutation and pcr inhibition.in our study, the sensitivity of rt-pcr was higher than that of the chest ct (78.5% vs 66.7%, respectively). the reasons for the relatively lower efficiency of chest ct is may include, 1) the major of covid-19 patients was mild, in the early detection, there is no features or typical features of chest ct in our study. 2) we divided three groups in the 365 patients, one group is covid-19 positive, the other group is covid-19 negative. our results support rt-pcr combine chest ct for first

510,Recombination and lineage-specific mutations led to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2,"abstractthe recent outbreak of a new coronavirus (sars-cov-2) in wuhan, china, underscores the need for understanding the evolutionary processes that drive the emergence and adaptation of zoonotic viruses in humans. here, we show that recombination in betacoronaviruses, including human-infecting viruses like sars-cov and mers-cov, frequently encompasses the receptor binding domain (rbd) in the spike gene. we find that this common process likely led to a recombination event at least 11 years ago in an ancestor of the sars-cov-2 involving the rbd. as a result of this recombination event, sars-cov and sars-cov-2 share a similar genotype in rbd, including two insertions (positions 432-436 and 460-472), and alleles 427n and 436y. both 427n and 436y belong to a helix that interacts with the human ace2 receptor. ancestral state analyses revealed that sars-cov-2 differentiated from its most recent common ancestor with ratg13 by accumulating a significant number of amino acid changes in the rbd. in sum, we propose a two-hit scenario in the emergence of the sars-cov-2 virus whereby the sars-cov-2 ancestors in bats first acquired genetic characteristics of sars-cov by incorporation of a sars-like rbd through recombination before 2009, and subsequently, the lineage that led to sars-cov-2 accumulated further, unique changes specifically in the rbd.","Juan Ángel Patiño-Galindo, Ioan 2+,  Filip, Mohammed 2+,  Alquraishi, Raul Rabadan"

349,Accurate Identification of SARS-CoV-2 from Viral Genome Sequences using Deep Learning,"abstractone of the reasons for the fast spread of sars-cov-2 is the lack of accuracy in detection tools in the clinical field. molecular techniques, such as quantitative real-time rt-pcr and nucleic acid sequencing methods, are widely used to identify pathogens. for this particular virus, however, they have an overall unsatisfying detection rate, due to its relatively recent emergence and still not completely understood features. in addition, sars-cov-2 is remarkably similar to other coronaviruses, and it can present with other respiratory infections, making identification even harder. to tackle this issue, we propose an assisted detection test, combining molecular testing with deep learning. the proposed approach employs a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network, able to automatically create features starting from the genome sequence of the virus.experiments on data from the novel coronavirus resource (2019ncovr) show that the proposed approach is able to correctly classify sars-cov-2, distinguishing it from other coronavirus strains, such as mers-cov, hcov-nl63, hcov-oc43, hcov-229e, hcov-hku1, and sars-cov regardless of missing information and errors in sequencing (noise). from a dataset of 553 complete genome non-repeated sequences that vary from 1,260 to 31,029 bps in length, the proposed approach classifies the different coronaviruses with an average ac-: biorxiv preprint curacy of 98.75% in a 10-fold cross-validation, identifying sars-cov-2 with an auc of 98%, specificity of 0.9939 and sensitivity of 1.00 in a binary classification. then, using the same basis, we classify sars-cov-2 from 384 complete viral genome sequences with human host, that contain the gene orf1ab from the ncbi with a 10-fold accuracy of 98.17% , a specificity of 0.9797 and sensitivity of 1.00. furthermore, an in-depth analysis of the results allow us to identify base pairs sequences that are unique to sars-cov-2 and do not appear in other virus strains, that could then be used as a base for designing new primers and examined by experts to extract further insights. these preliminary results seem encouraging enough to identify deep learning as a promising research venue to develop assisted detection tests for sars-cov-2. at this end the interaction between viromics and deep learning, will hopefully help to solve global infection problems. in addition, we offer our code and processed data to be used for diagnostic purposes by medical doctors, virologists and scientists involved in solving the sars-cov-2 pandemic. as more data become available we will update our system.","Alejandro Lopez-Rincon, Alberto Tonda, Lucero Mendoza-Maldonado, Eric Claassen, Johan Garssen, Aletta D Kraneveld"

287,Title: The SARS-CoV-2 exerts a distinctive strategy for interacting with the ACE2 human receptor,"abstractthe covid-19 disease has plagued over 110 countries and has resulted in over 4,000 deaths within 10 weeks. we compare the interaction between the human ace2 receptor and the sars-cov-2 spike protein with that of other pathogenic coronaviruses using molecular dynamics simulations. sars-cov, sars-cov-2, and hcov-nl63 recognize ace2 as the natural receptor but present a distinct binding interface to ace2 and a different network of residue-residue contacts. sars-cov and sars-cov-2 have comparable binding affinities achieved by balancing energetics and dynamics. the sars-cov-2-ace2 complex contains a higher number of contacts, a larger interface area, and decreased interface residue fluctuations relative to sars-cov. these findings expose an exceptional evolutionary exploration exerted by coronaviruses toward host recognition. we postulate that the versatility of cell receptor binding strategies has immediate implications on therapeutic strategies.one sentence summary: molecular dynamics simulations reveal a temporal dimension of coronaviruses interactions with the host receptor.","Esther S Brielle, Dina Schneidman-Duhovny, Michal Linial"

119,Nucleotide Analogues as Inhibitors of SARS-CoV Polymerase,"abstractsars-cov-2, a member of the coronavirus family, has caused a global public health emergency. 1 based on our analysis of hepatitis c virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously reasoned that the fda-approved heptatitis c drug epclusa (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) should inhibit coronaviruses, including sars-cov-2. 2 here, using model polymerase extension experiments, we demonstrate that the activated triphosphate form of sofosbuvir is incorporated by low-fidelity polymerases and sars-cov rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp), and blocks further incorporation by these polymerases; the activated triphosphate form of sofosbuvir is not incorporated by a host-like high-fidelity dna polymerase. using the same molecular insight, we selected two other anti-viral agents, alovudine and azt (an fda approved hiv/aids drug) for evaluation as inhibitors of sars-cov rdrp. we demonstrate the ability of two hiv reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 3'fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of alovudine and azt), to be incorporated by sars-cov rdrp where they also terminate further polymerase extension. given the 98% amino acid similarity of the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 rdrps, we expect these nucleotide analogues would also inhibit the sars-cov-2 polymerase. these results offer guidance to further modify these nucleotide analogues to generate more potent broad-spectrum anticoronavirus agents.the recent appearance of a new coronaviral infection, covid-19, in wuhan, china, and its worldwide spread, has made international headlines. already more than 3,000 deaths have been ascribed to this virus, and covid-19 has reached near pandemic status. the virus has been isolated from the lower respiratory tracts of patients with pneumonia, sequenced and visualized by electron microscopy. 1 the virus, designated sars-cov-2, is a new member of the subgenus sarbecovirus, in the orthocoronavirinae subfamily, but is distinct from mers-cov and sars-cov. 1 the coronaviruses are single strand rna viruses, sharing properties with other single-stranded rna viruses such as hepatitis c virus (hcv), west nile virus, marburg virus, hiv virus, ebola virus, dengue virus, and rhinoviruses. in particular, coronaviruses and hcv are both positive-sense single-strand rna viruses, 3,4 and thus have a similar replication mechanism requiring a rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp).the coronavirus life cycle has been described. 3 briefly, the virus enters the cell by endocytosis, is uncoated, and orf1a and orf1b of the positive strand rna is translated to produce nonstructural protein precursors, including a cysteine protease and a serine protease; these further cleave the precursors to form mature, functional helicase and rna-dependent rna polymerase. a replication-transcription complex is then . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 : biorxiv preprint sequence of the primer and template used for this extension reaction is shown at the top of the figure.polymerase extension reactions were performed by incubating utp with pre-assembled sars-cov polymerase (nsp12, nsp7 and nsp8), the indicated rna template and primer, and the appropriate reaction buffer, followed by detection of reaction products by maldi-tof ms. the detailed procedure is shown in the methods. the accuracy for m/z determination is ± 10 da.","Jingyue Ju, Xiaoxu Li, Shiv Kumar, Steffen Jockusch, Minchen Chien, Chuanjuan Tao, Irina Morozova, Sergey Kalachikov, Robert N Kirchdoerfer, James J Russo"

951,Estimating unobserved SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States,"abstractcountries across the world observed dramatic rises in covid-19 cases and deaths in march 2020. in the united states, delays in the availability of diagnostic testing have prompted questions about the extent of unobserved community transmission. using a simulation model informed by reported cases and deaths, we estimated that tens of thousands of people (median: 22,876, 95% posterior predictive interval: 7,451 -53,044) were infected by the time a national emergency was declared. our results also indicate that fewer than 10% of locally acquired, symptomatic infections in the us were detected throughout much of late february. these results point to the need for immediate, large-scale efforts to mitigate the impacts of sars-cov-2 on the us.sars-cov-2 is a newly emerged coronavirus that is causing a global pandemic ( 1 ) . the unprecedented spread of sars-cov-2 owes to its high transmissibility ( 2 ) , pre-symptomatic transmission ( 3 ) , and transmission by asymptomatic infections ( 4 ) . an appreciable fraction of infections are asymptomatic ( 5 ) , and many others result in mild symptoms that could be mistaken for other respiratory illnesses ( 6 ) . these factors point to a potentially large reservoir of unobserved infections ( 7 ) , especially in settings where capacity to test for sars-cov-2 has been limited ( 8 ) . the united states is one such country in which limited testing has been a major concern, particularly as imported cases, and now local cases, have increased over time ( 9 ) . until february 27, testing criteria in the us were limited to close contacts of confirmed cases and those with recent travel to china ( 9 ) . this means that any local infections resulting from an unobserved imported infection would have gone unnoticed. community transmission occurred without notice while testing was still being rolled out ( 10 , 11 ) , albeit to an unknown extent.our goal was to estimate the extent of community transmission of sars-cov-2 in the us that occurred prior to its widespread recognition. unlike other countries where testing and containment measures were pursued aggressively ( 12 , 13 ) , rollout of testing in the us was slow ( 9 ) and widespread social-distancing measures did not go into effect until several weeks after the first reported case ( 14 , 15 ) . understanding the extent of community transmission has major implications for the effectiveness of different options for control ( 16 ) and for anticipating the trajectory and impact of the pandemic ( 17 ) .this work has not yet been peer-reviewed.","T Alex Perkins, Sean M Cavany, Sean M Moore, Rachel J Oidtman, Anita Lerch, Marya Poterek"
735,Spread of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus likely to be constrained by climate,"abstractcov-2 (aka 2019-ncov) coronavirus are confirmed throughout the world and millions of people are being put into quarantine, few doubt the virus will reach pandemic state. some worry it could badly hit the developing world, such as sub-saharan africa, potentially leading to a global human calamity. it is still early days, but using existing data we develop a large ensemble of ecological niche models that project monthly variation in climate suitability of sars-cov-2 coronavirus throughout a typical climatological year. the current spread suggests a degree of climate determination with coronavirus displaying preference for cool and dry conditions. the predecessor sars-cov was linked to similar climate conditions. should the spread of sars cov-2 continue to follow current trends, a worst-case scenario of synchronous global pandemic is improbable. more probable is the emergence of asynchronous seasonal global outbreaks much like other respiratory diseases. people in temperate warm and cold climates are more vulnerable. those in arid climates follow next in vulnerability, while the disease will likely marginally affect the tropics. our projections minimize uncertainties related with spread of sars cov-2, providing critical information for anticipating the adequate social, economic and political responses.","Miguel B Araújo, Babak Naimi"

8547,ROLE OF CHANGES IN SARS-COV-2 SPIKE PROTEIN IN THE INTERACTION WITH THE HUMAN ACE2 RECEPTOR: AN IN SILICO ANALYSIS,"abstractmany human viral diseases are a consequence of a zoonotic event. some of the diseases caused by these zoonotic events have affected millions of people around the world, some of which have resulted in high rates of morbidity/mortality in humans. changes in the viral proteins that function as ligands of the host receptor may promote the spillover between species. the most recent of these zoonotic events that have caused an ongoing epidemic of high magnitude is the covid-19 epidemics caused by sars-cov-2. the aim of this study was to determine the mutation(s) in the sequence of the spike protein of the sars-cov-2 that might be favoring human to human transmission. an in silico approach was performed, and changes were detected in the s1 subunit of the receptor-binding domain of spike. the observed changes have significant effect on sars-cov-2 spike/ace2 interaction and produce a reduction in the binding energy, compared to the one of the bat-cov to this receptor. the data presented in this study suggest a higher affinity of the sars-cov-2 spike protein to the human ace2 receptor, compared to the one of bat-cov spike and ace2. this could be the cause of the rapid viral spread of sars-cov-2 in humans.","Joseph Thomas Ortega, Maria Luisa Serrano, Flor Helene Pujol, Hector Rafael Rangel"

638,The effect of human mobility and control measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in China,"abstractthe ongoing covid-19 outbreak has expanded rapidly throughout china. major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in china and worldwide. it remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected covid-19 spread in china. we use real-time mobility data from wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across china and ascertain the impact of control measures. early on, the spatial distribution of covid-19 cases in china was well explained by human mobility data. following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside wuhan. this study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in china have substantially mitigated the spread of covid-19.the outbreak of covid-19 has spread rapidly from its origin in wuhan, hubei province, china (1). a range of interventions have been implemented following the detection in late december 2019 of a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology, and identification of the causative virus sars-cov-2 in early january 2020 (2). interventions include improved rates of diagnostic testing, clinical management, rapid isolation of suspected and confirmed cases and, most notably, restrictions on mobility (hereafter called cordon sanitaire) imposed on wuhan city on 23 rd january. travel restrictions were subsequently imposed on 14 other cities across hubei province and partial movement restrictions have been enacted in many cities across china. initial analysis suggests that the wuhan cordon sanitaire resulted in an average delay of covid-19 spread to other cities of 3 days (3), but the true extent of the effect of the mobility restrictions and other types of interventions on transmission has not been examined in detail (4, 5).questions remain over how these interventions affected the spread of sars-cov-2 to locations outside of wuhan. we here use real-time mobility data, crowdsourced line-list data of cases with reported travel . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) the copyright holder for this preprint .","Moritz U G Kraemer, Chia-Hung Yang, Bernardo Gutierrez, Chieh-Hsi Wu, Brennan Klein, David M Pigott, R Faria, Ruoran Li, William P Hanage, John S Brownstein, Maylis Layan, Alessandro Vespignani, Huaiyu Tian, Christopher Dye, Simon Cauchemez, Oliver G Pybus, Samuel V Scarpino"

350,Potential impact of seasonal forcing on a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,"abstracta novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2) first detected in wuhan, china, has spread rapidly since december 2019, causing more than 80,000 confirmed infections and 2,700 fatalities (as of feb 27, 2020). imported cases and transmission clusters of various sizes have been reported globally suggesting a pandemic is likely. here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a sars-cov-2 pandemic. data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229e, hku1, nl63, oc43) and we parameterize our model for sars-cov-2 using these data. the model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. while the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. seasonal forcing on sars-cov-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. the likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.","Richard A Neher, Robert Dyrdak, Valentin Druelle, Emma B Hodcroft, Jan Albert"

794,Strong evolutionary convergence of receptor-binding protein spike between COVID-19 and SARS-related coronaviruses,"abstractcoronavirus disease 2019 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)-related coronaviruses (e.g., 2019-ncov and sars-cov) are phylogenetically distantly related, but both are capable of infecting human hosts via the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and cause similar clinical and pathological features, suggesting their phenotypic convergence. yet, the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown. here, we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence. our genome-level analyses show that the spike protein, which is responsible for receptor binding, has undergone significant darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019-ncov and sars-cov. further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain (rbd) of the spike protein between covid-19 and sars-related cov clades, leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their rbd protein sequences. in addition to the spike protein, we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, orf3a, suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence. our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between covid-19 and sars-related cov, possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors. finally, it should be noted that many observed bat sars-like covs that have an evolutionary convergent rbd sequence with 2019-ncov and sars-cov may be preadapted to human host receptor ace2, and hence would be potential new coronavirus sources to infect humans in the future.",Yonghua Wu

247,A mathematical model for the spatiotemporal epidemic spreading of COVID19,"abstract166 countries/regions, including cases of human-to-human transmission around the world. the proportions of this epidemics is probably one of the largest challenges faced by our interconnected modern societies. according to the current epidemiological reports, the large basic reproduction number, r0 ∼ 2.3, number of secondary cases produced by an infected individual in a population of susceptible individuals, as well as an asymptomatic period (up to 14 days) in which infectious individuals are undetectable without further analysis, pave the way for a major crisis of the national health capacity systems. recent scientific reports have pointed out that the detected cases of covid19 at young ages is strikingly short and that lethality is concentrated at large ages. here we adapt a microscopic markov chain approach (mmca) metapopulation mobility model to capture the spread of covid-19. we propose a model that stratifies the population by ages, and account for the different incidences of the disease at each strata. the model is used to predict the incidence of the epidemics in a spatial population through time, permitting investigation of control measures. the model is applied to the current epidemic in spain, using the estimates of the epidemiological parameters and the mobility and demographic census data of the national institute of statistics (ine). the results indicate that the peak of incidence will happen in the first half of april 2020 in absence of mobility restrictions. these results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and can be adapted to precise mobility restrictions at the level of municipalities. the current estimates largely compromises the spanish health capacity system, in particular that for intensive care units, from the end of march. however, the model allows for the scrutiny of containment measures that can be used for health authorities to forecast with accuracy their impact in prevalence of covid-19. here we show by testing different epidemic containment scenarios that we urge to enforce total lockdown to avoid a massive collapse of the spanish national health system.","Alex Arenas, Wesley Cota, Jesús Gómez-Gardeñes, Sergio Gómez, Clara Granell, Joan T Matamalas, David Soriano, Benjamin Steinegger"

7483,Cell Discovery Network-based drug repurposing for novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2,"abstracthuman coronaviruses (hcovs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov, also known as sars-cov-2), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. however, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-ncov/sars-cov-2. drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. in this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the hcov-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. phylogenetic analyses of 15 hcov whole genomes reveal that 2019-ncov/sars-cov-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity with sars-cov (79.7%). specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-ncov/sars-cov-2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to sars-cov. using network proximity analyses of drug targets and hcov-host interactions in the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti-hcov repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and hcov-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. we further identify three potential drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the ""complementary exposure"" pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the hcov-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. in summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting 2019-ncov/sars-cov-2.","Yadi Zhou, Yuan Hou, Jiayu Shen, Yin Huang, William Martin, Feixiong Cheng"

670,Quantifying dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission suggests that epidemic control and avoidance is feasible through instantaneous digital contact tracing,"abstractmobile phone apps implementing algorithmic contact tracing can speed up the process of tracing newly diagnosed individuals, spreading information instantaneously back through a past contact network to inform them that they are at risk of being infected, and thus allow them to take appropriate social distancing and testing measures. the aim of non-pharmaceutical infection prevention is to move a population towards herd protection, a state where a population maintains r 0 <1, thus making it impossible for a pathogen to cause an epidemic. here, we address epidemiological issues that affect the feasibility of an algorithmic approach to instantaneous contact tracing; ethical and implementation issues are addressed separately. first we quantify the parameters of covid-19 in a framework that is consistent with the renewal equation formulation of epidemic spread. second, we use an analytical solution to application of first-degree contact tracing in the renewal equation model to explore combinations of efficacy that can induce herd protection (r 0 <1). with the emergence of the novel viral pathogen sars-cov-2, of clear potential for a global pandemic with high fatality rates and incapacitated health systems, the question of prevention has critical priority. we come to the conclusion that isolating symptomatic cases and tracing their contacts in a classical manner is not sufficiently fast to stop the spread of the epidemic and needs to be accompanied by measures of social distancing that are disruptive to a wide number of people. we show that first-degree instantaneous contact tracing, informing users when they can move safely or when to seek medical help and avoid vulnerable individuals, has the potential to stop the spread of the epidemic if used by a sufficiently large number of people with reasonable fidelity. all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission. author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.","Luca Ferretti, Chris Wymant, Michelle Kendall, Lele Zhao, Anel Nurtay, David Bonsall, Christophe Fraser"

898,Is a 14-day quarantine period optimal for effectively controlling coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?,"abstractthe outbreak of a new coronavirus (sars-cov-2) disease has become pandemic. to be more effectively controlling the disease, it is critical to set up an optimal quarantine period so that about 95% of the cases developing symptoms will be retained for isolation. at the moment, the who-established quarantine period is 14 days based on previous reports which had studied small sizes of hospitalized cases (10 and ~100, respectively), however, over 80% of adult-and 95% of child-cases were not necessary to stay in hospitals, and therefore, had not been hospitalized. therefore, we are questioning if the current-inferred median incubation time is representative for the whole covid-19 population, and if the current quarantine period is optimal.we compiled and analyzed the patient-level information of 2015 laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases including 99 children in 28 chinese provinces. this cohort represents a wide-range spectrum of covid-19 disease with both hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases.the full range of incubation periods of the covid-19 cases ranged from 0 to 33 days among 2015 cases. there were 6 (0.13%) symptom-free cases including 4 females with a median age of 25.5 years and 2 males with a median age of 36 years. the median incubation period of both male and female adults was similar (7-day) but significantly shorter than that (9-day) of child cases (p=0.02). this cohort contained 4 transmission generations, and incubation periods of the cases between generations were not significantly different, suggesting that the virus has not been rapidly adapted to human beings. interestingly, incubation periods of 233 cases (11.6%) were longer than the who-established quarantine period (14 days). data modeling suggested that if adults take an extra 4-day or 7-day of isolation (i.e., a quarantine period of 18 or 21 days), 96.2% or 98.3%, respectively, of the people who are developing symptoms will be more effectively quarantined. patients transmitted via lunch/dinner parties (i.e., gastrointestinal tract infection . cc-by-nc 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) the copyright holder for this preprint .","Xue Jiang, Yawei Niu, Xiong Li, Lin Li, Wenxiang Cai, Yucan Chen, Bo Liao, Edwin Wang"
258,Characterisation of the transcriptome and proteome of SARS-CoV-2 using direct RNA sequencing and tandem mass spectrometry reveals evidence for a cell passage induced in-frame deletion in the spike glycoprotein that removes the furin-like cleavage site,"abstractdirect rna sequencing using an oxford nanopore minion characterised the transcriptome of sars-cov-2 grown in vero e6 cells. this cell line is being widely used to propagate the novel coronavirus. the viral transcriptome was analysed using a recently developed orf-centric pipeline. this revealed the pattern of viral transcripts, (i.e. subgenomic mrnas), generally fitted the predicted replication and transcription model for coronaviruses. a 24 nt in-frame deletion was detected in subgenomic mrnas encoding the spike (s) glycoprotein. this feature was identified in over half of the mapped transcripts and was predicted to remove a proposed furin cleavage site from the s glycoprotein. this motif directs cleavage of the s glycoprotein into functional subunits during virus entry or exit. cleavage of the s glycoprotein can be a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus transmission and affect viral pathogenicity. allied to this transcriptome analysis, tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify over 500 viral peptides and 44 phosphopeptides, covering almost all of the proteins predicted to be encoded by the sars-cov-2 genome, including peptides unique to the deleted variant of the s glycoprotein. detection of an apparently viable deletion in the furin cleavage site of the s glycoprotein reinforces the point that this and other regions of sars-cov-2 proteins may readily mutate. this is of clear significance given the interest in the s glycoprotein as a potential vaccine target and the observation that the furin cleavage site likely contributes strongly to the pathogenesis and zoonosis of this virus. the viral genome sequence should be carefully monitored during the growth of viral stocks for research, animal challenge models and, potentially, in clinical samples. such variations may result in different levels of virulence, morbidity and mortality.","Andrew D Davidson, Maia Kavanagh Williamson, Sebastian Lewis, Deborah Shoemark, Miles W Carroll, Kate Heesom, Maria Zambon, Joanna Ellis, Phillip A Lewis, Julian A Hiscox, David A Matthews, U K , D A Matthews"

1016,Mucin 4 Protects Female Mice from Coronavirus Pathogenesis,"abstractusing incipient lines of the collaborative cross (cc), a murine genetic reference population, we previously identified a quantitative trait loci (qtl) associated with low sars-cov titer. in this study, we integrated sequence information and rna expression of genes within the qtl to identify mucin 4 (muc4) as a high priority candidate for controlling sars-cov titer in the lung.to test this hypothesis, we infected muc4 -/mice and found that female, but not male, muc4 -/mice developed more weight loss and disease following infection with sars-cov. femalemuc4 -/mice also had more difficulty breathing despite reduced lung pathology; however, no change in viral titers was observed. comparing across viral families, studies with chikungunya virus, a mosquito-borne arthralgic virus, suggests that muc4's impact on viral pathogenesis may be widespread. although not confirming the original titer qtl, our data identifies a role for muc4 in the sars-cov disease and viral pathogenesis.given the recent emergence of sars-cov-2, this work suggest that muc4 expression plays a protective role in female mice not conserved in male mice following sars-cov infection. with the sars-cov-2 outbreak continuing, treatments that modulate or enhance muc4 activity may provide an avenue for treatment and improved outcomes. in addition, the work highlights the importance of studying host factors including host genetics and biological sex as key parameters influencing infection and disease outcomes.","Jessica A Plante, Kenneth S Plante, Lisa E Gralinski, Anne Beall, Martin T Ferris, Daniel Bottomly, Richard Green, Shannon K Mcweeney, Mark T Heise, Ralph S Baric, Vineet D Menachery"

657,Impact of self-imposed prevention measures and short-term government intervention on mitigating and delaying a COVID-19 epidemic,"abstract1background: with new cases of covid-19 surging around the world, some countries may have to prepare 2 for moving beyond the containment phase. prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for 3 mitigating, delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the increased 4 seasonal influenza activity.methods: we developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed prevention measures 6 (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to covid-19 awareness and of short-term government-7 imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate and time until the peak number of 8 diagnoses.findings: for fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack 10 rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. a large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy 11 of these measures exceeds 50%. for slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number 12 of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. early implementation of short-term 13 government interventions can only delay the peak.14 interpretation: handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing as a reaction to information dissemination 15 about covid-19 can be effective strategies to mitigate and delay the epidemic. we stress the importance of 16 a rapid spread of awareness on the use of self-imposed prevention measures in the population. early-initiated 17 short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing 18 covid-19 burden.evidence to date suggests that containment of sars-cov-2 using quarantine, travel restrictions, isolation of symp-26 tomatic cases, and contact tracing may need to be supplemented by other interventions. given its rapid spread 27 across the world and huge implications for public health, it is urgent to understand whether non-case-based inter-28 ventions can mitigate, delay or even prevent a covid-19 epidemic. one strategy is a broader-scale contact rate 29 reduction enforced by governments which was used during previous outbreaks, e.g., the 1918 influenza pandemic and 30 the 2009 influenza a/h1n1 pandemic in mexico. alternatively, governments and media may stimulate self-imposed 31 prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) by generating awareness about covid-32 19, especially when economic and societal consequences are taken into account. both of these strategies may have 33 a significant impact on the outbreak dynamics. currently, there are no comparative studies that investigate their 34 viability for controlling a covid-19 epidemic.added value of this study 36 using a transmission model parameterized with current best estimates of epidemiological parameters, we evaluated 37 the impact of handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing due to covid-19 awareness and of government-38 imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate, and time until the peak number of diagnoses. 39 we show that a short-term (1-3 months) government intervention initiated early into the outbreak can only delay 40 the peak number of diagnoses but neither alters its magnitude nor the attack rate. our analyses also highlight 41 the importance of spreading awareness about covid-19 in the population, as the impact of self-imposed measures 42 is strongly dependent on it. when awareness spreads fast, simple self-imposed measures such as handwashing are 43 more effective than short-term government intervention. self-imposed measures do not only diminish and postpone 44 the peak number of diagnoses, but they can prevent a large epidemic altogether when their efficacy is sufficiently 45 high (about 50%). qualitatively, these results will allow public health professionals to compare interventions for 46 designing effective outbreak control policies.implications of all available evidence 48 our results highlight that dissemination of evidence-based information on effective prevention measures (hand-49 washing, mask-wearing, and self-imposed social distancing) can be a key strategy for mitigating and postponing a 50 covid-19 epidemic. government interventions (e.g., closing schools and prohibiting mass gatherings) implemented 51 early into the epidemic and lasting for a short-time can only buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for the 52","Alexandra Teslya, Thi Mui †1,  Pham, Noortje G Godijk, Mirjam E Kretzschmar, Martin C J Bootsma, Ganna Rozhnova"

310,Diarrhea may be underestimated: a missing link in 2019 novel coronavirus,"abstractbased on results of inter-group difference test, we found that the incidence of diarrhea differed in three recent reports. as 2019-ncov utilizes the same cell entry receptor ace2 as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) and ace2 tightly controls intestinal inflammation, to trace the route of infection mediated by 2019-ncov, we used the single-cell rna sequencing data for analysis. we found that the ace2 mrna was highly expressed in the healthy human small intestine rather than the lung. besides, single-cell rna sequencing data showed that ace2 was significantly elevated in the proximal and distal enterocytes, where the small intestinal epithelium is exposed to the foreign pathogen. thus, we suspect that ace2-expressing small intestinal epithelium cells might be vulnerable to 2019-ncov infection when people eat infected wild animals and diarrhea may serve as an indicator for infection, suggesting that clinicians should pay more attention to patients with diarrhea during the outbreak of pneumonia.of exported infection cases have been identified in japan, korea, the united states, canada, france, etc. on january 30, 2020, the who has confirmed 7,818 cases worldwide, and 7,736 cases were reported in china.according to clinical observation, the most common symptoms were fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue. less common symptoms included sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea. based on three recent publications 1-3 , we compared the incidence of these common symptoms and found that the incidence of diarrhea significantly differed in these three reports. as some patients suffering from diarrhea will first seek help from the gastroenterologist, incorrect estimation of diarrhea may increase the risk of 2019-ncov infection in the gastroenterology department. therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the clinical features of pneumonia patients will further improve hospital infection control and reduce healthcare-associated infection.by using the next-generation sequencing technology, scientists revealed that the sequence and genome structure of 2019-ncov is highly homologous to that of sars-cov 4,5 . it has been reported that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) serves as a receptor-binding domain complexed with receptor. science 2005;309:1864-8. 7. wan y, shang j, graham r, baric rs, li f. receptor recognition by novel coronavirus from wuhan: an analysis based on decade-long structural studies of sars.journal of virology 2020.","Weicheng Liang, Zhijie Feng, Shitao Rao, Cuicui Xiao, Ze-Xiao Lin, Qi Zhang, Qi Wei, Wei Qi,  Qi Zhang"

574,"Bulk and single-cell transcriptomics identify tobacco-use disparity in lung gene expression of ACE2, the receptor of 2019-nCov","abstractin current severe global emergency situation of 2019-ncov outbreak, it is imperative to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for effective protection and care. recently, studies found that 2019-ncov and sars-ncov share the same receptor, ace2. in this study, we analyzed five large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ace2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types.we didn't find significant disparities in ace2 gene expression between racial groups (asian vs caucasian), age groups (>60 vs <60) or gender groups (male vs female). however, we observed significantly higher ace2 gene expression in former smoker's lung compared to non-smoker's lung. also, we found higher ace2 gene expression in asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. in addition, we found that ace2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. in bronchial epithelium, ace2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. in alveoli, ace2 is actively expressed in remodelled at2 cells of former smokers. together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-ncov and have infection paths different with non-smokers. thus, smoking history may provide valuable information in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.",Guoshuai Cai

502,Assessing the plausibility of subcritical transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States,"abstractthe 2019-ncov outbreak has raised concern of global spread. while person-to-person transmission within the wuhan district has led to a large outbreak, the transmission potential outside of the region remains unclear. here we present a simple approach for determining whether the upper limit of the confidence interval for the reproduction number exceeds one for transmission in the united states, which would allow endemic transmission. as of february 7, 2020, the number of cases in the united states support subcritical transmission, rather than ongoing transmission. however, this conclusion can change if pre-symptomatic cases resulting from human-to-human transmission have not yet been identified.the 2019-ncov outbreak is a global health risk, especially considering the number of patients who have already died after becoming infected in wuhan, china. many initial characterizations of the virus have focused on the basic reproduction number, r , which reflects the average number of infections that each new infection causes in a susceptible population. whenever r is greater than one, epidemic transition becomes possible and within the wuhan province, r has been estimated as high as 4.1 1-3 .","Seth Blumberg, Thomas M Lietman, Travis C Porco, Francis I Proctor Foundation"

497,Insights into Cross-species Evolution of Novel Human Coronavirus 2019-nCoV and Defining Immune Determinants for Vaccine Development,"abstractnovel coronavirus (ncov) outbreak in the city of wuhan, china during december 2019, has now spread to various countries across the globe triggering a heightened containment effort. this human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus carrying 30 kilobase of single positive-sense rna genome. understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts. the present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-ncov genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. this ncov genotype might have been evolved from a bat-cov by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. structural proteins spike (s), and membrane (m) had extensive mutational changes, whereas envelope (e) and nucleocapsid (n) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-ncov during evolution. interestingly, 2019-ncov spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide sequence insertion relative to sarslike bat-sl-covzc45/2017. furthermore, we identified eight high binding affinity (hba) cd4 t-cell epitopes in the s, e, m and n proteins, which can be commonly recognized by hla-dr alleles of asia and asia-pacific region population. these immunodominant epitopes can be incorporated in universal subunit cov vaccine. diverse hla types and variations in the epitope binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus in humans. our findings emphasize the requirement for continuous surveillance of cov strains in live animal markets to better understand the viral adaptation to human host and to develop practical solutions to prevent the emergence of novel pathogenic cov strains.","Arunachalam Ramaiah, Vaithilingaraja Arumugaswami"
444,Fast assessment of human receptor-binding capability of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),"abstractthe outbreaks of 2002/2003 sars, 2012/2015 mers and 2019/2020 wuhan respiratory syndrome clearly indicate that genome evolution of an animal coronavirus (cov) may enable it to acquire human transmission ability, and thereby to cause serious threats to global public health. it is widely accepted that cov human transmission is driven by the interactions of its spike protein (s-protein) with human receptor on host cell surface; so, quantitative evaluation of these interactions may be used to assess the human transmission capability of covs. however, quantitative methods directly using viral genome data are still lacking. here, we perform large-scale protein-protein docking to quantify the interactions of 2019-ncov s-protein receptor-binding domain (s-rbd) with human receptor ace2, based on experimental sars-cov s-rbd-ace2 complex structure. by sampling a large number of thermodynamically probable binding conformations with monte carlo algorithm, this approach successfully identified the experimental complex structure as the lowest-energy receptor-binding conformations, and hence established an experiment-based strength reference for evaluating the receptor-binding affinity of 2019-ncov via comparison with sars-cov. our results show that thisbinding affinity is about 73% of that of sars-cov, supporting that 2019-ncov may cause human transmission similar to that of sars-cov. thus, this study presents a method for rapidly assessing the human transmission capability of a newly emerged cov and its mutant strains, and demonstrates that post-genome analysis of protein-protein interactions may provide early scientific guidance for viral prevention and control.","Qiang Huang, Andreas Herrmann"

7844,Clinical Medicine Estimation of the Transmission Risk of the 2019-nCoV and Its Implication for Public Health Interventions,"abstractsince the emergence of the first cases in wuhan, china, the novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) infection has been quickly spreading out to other provinces and neighboring countries. estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. a deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. the estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% ci 5.71-7.23). sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by wuhan on 2019-ncov infection in beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. it is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-ncov infection, and how long they should be maintained. under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 january 2020) with a significant low peak value. with travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction.","Biao Tang, Xia Wang, Qian Li, Nicola Luigi Bragazzi, Sanyi Tang, Yanni Xiao, Jianhong Wu"

1951,An updated estimation of the risk of transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov)-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/),"abstractthe basic reproduction number of an infectious agent is the average number of infections one case can generate over the course of the infectious period, in a naïve, uninfected population. it is well-known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period. with the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate. due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-ncov need to be revised. by using time-dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until january 29th , 2020 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions. we estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below 1 and when the epidemics will peak. our updated findings suggest that the best measure is persistent and strict self-isolation. the epidemics will continue to grow, and can peak soon with the peak time depending highly on the public health interventions practically implemented.","Biao Tang, Nicola Luigi Bragazzi, Qian Li, Sanyi Tang, Yanni Xiao, Jianhong Wu"

201,Host and infectivity prediction of Wuhan 2019 novel coronavirus using deep learning algorithm,"abstractthe recent outbreak of pneumonia in wuhan, china caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) emphasizes the importance of detecting novel viruses and predicting their risks of infecting people. in this report, we introduced the vhp (virus host prediction) to predict the potential hosts of viruses using deep learning algorithm. our prediction suggests that 2019-ncov has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), bat sars-like coronaviruses and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov). based on our prediction, compared to the coronaviruses infecting other vertebrates, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-ncovs. furthermore, by comparing the infectivity patterns of all viruses hosted on vertebrates, we found mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-ncov. these consequences of infectivity pattern analysis illustrate that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019-ncov.these results warn us to beware of 2019-ncov and guide us to further explore the properties and reservoir of it. one sentence summary: it is of great value to identify whether a newly discovered virus has the risk of infecting human. guo et al. proposed a virus host prediction method based on deep learning to detect what kind of host a virus can infect with dna sequence as input.","Qian Guo, † , Mo Li, Chunhui Wang, Peihong Wang, Zhencheng Fang, Jie Tan, Shufang Wu, Yonghong Xiao, Huaiqiu Zhu"

765,Beyond R 0 : the importance of contact tracing when predicting epidemics,"abstractthe basic reproductive number -r 0 -is one of the most common and most commonly misapplied numbers in public health. nevertheless, estimating r 0 for every transmissible pathogen, emerging or endemic, remains a priority for epidemiologists the world over. although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same r 0 . here, we show how predicting outbreak size requires both an estimate of r 0 and an estimate of the heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections. to facilitate rapid determination of outbreak risk, we propose a reformulation of a classic result from random network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment (r 0 ) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. further, we show how this framework is robust in the face of the typically limited amount of data for emerging pathogens. lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging pathogens like 2019-ncov, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically, in the case of 2019-ncov from 5-40% of susceptible individuals. taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond r 0 when predicting epidemic size.","Laurent Hébert-Dufresne, Benjamin M Althouse, Samuel V Scarpino, Antoine Allard"

848,Effects of Chinese strategies for controlling the diffusion and deterioration of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in China,"abstractbackground: in december 2019, an outbreak of new type of coronavirus named covid-19 occurred in wuhan, hubei province, china. in a very short time, this virus spread rapidly over china, greatly threatening public health and economic development.the chinese government acted quickly and implemented a series of strategies to prevent diffusion of this disease. we therefore sought to evaluate the effects of these chinese strategies for controlling the spread of covid-19.commission websites of china, we performed model fitting and calculated the growth speed of cumulative confirmed patients. we further analyzed the time when this growth speed, the rate of the number of new cases, reached its maximum (speedmax).comparing different times to speedmax of different areas in china, we calculated the dates at which the growth speed began to decline in different areas. also, the number of plateaus were analyzed.: the quartic model showed the best fit. for almost all areas in mainland china, the speed of infections reached speedmax and began to decline within 14 days; exceptions were hebei, heilongjiang, hainan, guizhou, and hubei. the number of plateaus was significantly correlated with the emigration index. however, the distance from other areas to hubei and the number of plateaus had little influence on when a province or area arrived at speedmax. once strict intervention strategies were implemented, diffusion and deterioration of covid-19 were inhibited quickly and effectively over china. conclusion: our study suggests that chinese strategies are highly effective on controlling the diffusion and deterioration of the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia. these strategies supply experience and guidelines for other countries to control the covid-19 epidemic. : medrxiv preprint the diffusion and deterioration of covid-19 were inhibited quickly and effectively over china. with the exception of wuhan, even hubei, where the cumulative confirmed patients reached 17,680 on february 23, 2020, the speed of growth still reached speedmax and began to decline in 14-15 days.","Xiaoqiang Wang, Weitian-Tian 1#, Xin Lv, Yumiao Shi, Xiaoxin Zhou, Weifeng Yu, Diansan Su, Jie Tian"
394,Kallikrein 13: a new player in coronaviral infections. 1 2,"abstracthuman coronavirus hku1 (hcov-hku1) is associated with respiratory disease and is 36 prevalent worldwide, but in vitro model for virus replication is lacking. interaction between the 37 coronaviral spike (s) protein and its receptor is the major determinant of virus tissue and host 38 specificity, but virus entry is a complex process requiring a concerted action of multiple cellular 39 elements. here, we show that klk13 is required for the infection of the human respiratory 40 epithelium and is sufficient to mediate the entry of hcov-hku1 to non-permissive rd cells. 41 we also demonstrated hcov-hku1 s protein cleavage by klk13 in the s1/s2 region, proving 42 that klk13 is the priming enzyme for this virus. summarizing, we show for the first time that 43 protease distribution and specificity predetermines the tissue and cell specificity of the virus 44 and may also regulate interspecies transmission. it is also of importance that presented data may 45 be relevant for the emerging coronaviruses, including sars-cov-2 and may help to understand 46 the differences in their zoonotic potential. : biorxiv preprintcoronaviruses are the largest group within the order nidovirales. mainly, they cause 49 respiratory and enteric diseases in humans and animals, but some can cause more serious 50 conditions such as hepatitis, peritonitis, or neurological disease. seven coronaviruses infect 51 humans, four of which (human coronavirus hcov]-229e, hcov-nl63, hcov-oc43, and 52 hcov-hku1) cause relatively mild upper and lower respiratory tract disease and two (sars-53 cov and mers-cov) are associated with severe, life-threatening respiratory infections and 54 multiorgan failure (1-6). furthermore, in december 2019 a novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 55 emerged in hubei province, china, causing pneumonia. to date, almost 90,000 cases were 56 identified and 3,000 patients died worldwide. 57 coronaviral infection is initiated by interaction between the trimeric spike (s) protein 58 and its receptor, which is expressed on the surface of the susceptible cell. a number of adhesion 59 and entry receptors have been described for coronaviruses. for example, hcov-229e (similar 60 to many other alphacoronaviruses) utilizes aminopeptidase n (apn) as the primary entry port 61 (7). surprisingly, its cousin hcov-nl63 shares receptor specificity with the evolutionarily 62 distant sars-cov and sars-cov-2: all hijack angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) (8-63 11). hcov-nl63 was also shown to use heparan sulfate as a primary attachment site (12-14). 64 a very different receptor is recognized by mers-cov, which binds to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 65 (dpp4) (9, 15, 16). another betacoronavirus, hcov-oc43, binds to n-acetyl-9-o-66 acetylneuraminic acid (17, 18). hcov-hku1 remains the great unknown because its cellular 67 receptor has not been identified and all efforts to culture the virus in vitro have failed.68 hcov-hku1 was identified in hong kong in 2004. the virus was present in a sample 69 obtained from an elderly patient with severe pneumonia (19). epidemiological studies show a 70 high prevalence of the pathogen in humans; this is because the majority of children seroconvert and others reported that ex vivo fully differentiated human airway epithelium (hae) and human 73 alveolar type ii cells support the infection (22-25). a thorough study by huang x et al. 74 demonstrated that hcov-hku1 binds to target cells via o-acetylated sialic acids on the cell 75 surface; however, this interaction is not sufficient for the infection. the study also showed that 76 the hemagglutinin-esterase (he) protein of hcov-hku1 exhibits sialate-o-acetylesterase 77 activity and may act as a receptor-destroying enzyme, thereby facilitating the release of viral 78 progeny (26). bakkers et al. proposed that, in order to adapt to the sialoglycome of the human 79 respiratory tract over the evolutionary timescale, hcov-hku1 lost the ability to bind to 80 attachment receptors via the he protein (27). recently, hulswit et al. mapped the virus binding 81site to o-acetylated sialic acids, demonstrating that the s1 domain a is responsible for binding 82 to the attachment receptor (28).the s protein is the main player during coronavirus entry, and its characteristics 84 determine the host range. coronaviral s proteins are class i fusion proteins comprising a large 85 n-terminal ectodomain, a hydrophobic trans-membrane region, and a small c-terminal 86 endodomain. the ectodomain is highly glycosylated and is composed of s1 and s2 domains.the globular s1 domain is highly variable and carries the receptor-binding site, whereas the 88 more conserved rod-like s2 domain undergoes structural rearrangement during entry, which 89 brings the cellular and viral membranes into close proximity. such a structural switch may be 90 triggered by different stimuli, including receptor binding, proteolytic cleavage of the s protein, 91 and/or a reduction in ph. because different species require different stimuli, coronaviruses enter 92 cells at different subcellular sites. some coronaviruses fuse at the plasma membrane, whereas 93 others are believed to enter the cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis, followed by fusion 94 deep within the endosomal compartments (29-35). furthermore, recent reports show that the 95 author/funder. all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission. entry portal may vary depending on tissue/cell characteristics. these differences may affect the 96 host range, pathogenicity, and cell/tissue specificity (1). 97 host proteases prime coronaviral s proteins. for example, trypsin-mediated cleavage in 98 the small intestine is required for entry of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (36), while a number 99 of coronaviruses from different genera (including hcov-oc43, hcov-hku1, murine 100 hepatitis virus mhv], mers-cov, and infectious bronchitis virus ibv]) possess a furin 101 cleavage site (37-41). kam et al. showed that sars-cov s protein can be cleaved by plasmin; 102 however, there is almost no biological evidence for its role in vivo (42). cathepsins may also 103 act as s protein-activating enzymes. indeed, cathepsin l processes the s proteins of sars-104 cov, mers-cov, hcov-229e, and mhv-2 (43-46). however, recent reports show that, in 105 vivo, respiratory coronaviruses may be activated by the tmprss2 protease, which enables 106 endocytosis-independent internalization, thereby re-shaping the entry process (45, 47-50). 107 while laboratory strains require priming by cathepsins, s proteins of clinical isolates (e.g., 108 hcov-229e and hcov-oc43) undergo tmprss2-mediated cleavage at the cell surface, 109 which enables them to fuse with the cell membrane on the cell surface (51). a recent study by 110 shirato et al. demonstrates that coronaviruses may lose their ability to infect naturally 111 permissive hae cultures during cell culture adaptation because the s gene evolves and adjusts 112 to the proteolytic landscape of the immortalized cells (51).113here, we identified a protease belonging to the tissue kallikrein (klk) family as a new 114 player essential for hcov-hku1 entry to the target cell. the klk family comprises 15 closely 115 related serine proteases with trypsin-or chymotrypsin-like specificity. the expression of these 116 enzymes is tightly regulated, and each tissue has its own unique klk expression profile. these 117 enzymes play a role in a diverse range of processes during embryonic development to adulthood 118 (52-56), and some have been linked to human cancers (57-60). the function of some klks 119 remains to be elucidated, but obtained results suggest that protease distribution may be an 120 author/funder. all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.important factor pre-determining the cell and tissue specificity of the virus, but also regulating 121 the interspecies transfers.further, the data presented herein bring us a step closer to developing a convenient 123 in vitro culture model and possibly identifying the cellular receptor for this virus. it is also of 124 importance that presented data may be relevant for the emerging coronaviruses and may help 125 to understand the differences in their zoonotic potential. 128 first, we asked whether hcov-hku1 infection modulates the expression of human 129 klks. hae cultures were infected with hcov-hku1 or mock-inoculated. at 120 h post-130 inoculation (p.i.), cells were collected and the expression of mrnas encoding klks was 131 analyzed. we detected the expression of klk7, klk8, klk10, klk11, and klk13 in 132 non-infected fully differentiated cultures. however, the pattern in hcov-hku1-infected cells 133 was different: we detected an upregulation of klk7, klk8, klk10, klk11 and klk13. 134 further, klk1, klk5, klk6, klk9, klk12 and klk14 were expressed in the infected cells. 135 klk2, klk3, and klk15 were not expressed (fig. 1). 136 137 klk13 is essential for hcov-hku1 infection 138 s protein priming is a prerequisite for coronavirus entry; therefore, we tested whether 139 klks take part in this process by culturing cells in the presence/absence of klk inhibitors ( 140 table 1 ) (61). for this, hae cultures were pre-incubated with each inhibitor (10 µm) or with 141 vehicle control (dmso) and mock-inoculated or inoculated with the virus (10 6 rna copies per 142 ml) in the presence of the inhibitor. apical washes were collected each day for analysis of virus 143 replication. subsequently, viral rna was isolated and reverse transcribed (rt), and the hcov-144 hku1 yield was determined by quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr). the results showed that 145 hcov-hku1 replication was inhibited in the presence of a klk13 inhibitor; this was not the 146 case for cells treated with dmso or with inhibitors specific for klk7 or klk8 ( fig. 2a) . 147 next, we analyzed hcov-hku1 replication in the presence of a family-specific klk 148 inhibitor spink6 at a concentration of 10 µg/ml (62, 63) or 100 µm camostat (a broad inhibitor 149 of serine proteases, also a potent inhibitor of klk13) (34, 64). we noted inhibition of 150 author/funder. all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.","Aleksandra Milewska, Katherine Falkowski, Magdalena Kalinska, Ewa Bielecka, Antonina Naskalska, Pawel Mak, Adam Lesner, Marek Ochman, Maciej Urlik, Jan ,  Potempa, Tomasz Kantyka, Krzysztof Pyrc"

746,Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions for containing the COVID-19 outbreak in China,"abstractthe covid-19 outbreak containment strategies in china based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (npis) appear to be effective. quantitative research is still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate npis and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the world.we built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (seir) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland china. we used epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of outbreak in wuhan to parameterise the transmission before npis were implemented. to quantify the relative effect of various npis, daily changes of delay from illness onset to the first reported case in each county were used as a proxy for the improvement of case identification and isolation across the outbreak. historical and near-real time human movement data, obtained from baidu location-based service, were used to derive the intensity of travel restrictions and contact reductions across china. the model and outputs were validated using daily reported case numbers, with a series of sensitivity analyses conducted.we estimated that there were a total of 114,325 covid-19 cases (interquartile range iqr] 76,776 -164,576) in mainland china as of february 29, 2020, and these were highly correlated (p<0.001, r 2 =0.86) with reported incidence.without npis, the number of covid-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (iqr: 44 -94), with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. the early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but integrated npis would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect. if npis could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier in china, cases could have been reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively, together with significantly reducing the number of affected areas. however, if npis were conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks later, the number of cases . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) the copyright holder for this preprint .","Shengjie Lai, Nick W Ruktanonchai, Liangcai Zhou, Olivia Prosper, Wei Luo, Jessica R Floyd, Amy Wesolowski, Mauricio Santillana, Chi Zhang, Xiangjun Du, Hongjie Yu, Andrew J Tatem, U K Southampton, S Lai, W R Ruktanonchai, J R Floyd, A J Tatem, W Luo, M Santillana"

12315,Clinical Medicine Communicating the Risk of Death from Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19),"abstractto understand the severity of infection for a given disease, it is common epidemiological practice to estimate the case fatality risk, defined as the risk of death among cases. however, there are three technical obstacles that should be addressed to appropriately measure this risk. first, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases tends to underestimate the actual risk because deaths that will occur have not yet observed, and so the delay in time from illness onset to death must be addressed. second, the observed dataset of reported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who are never diagnosed. third, ascertainment bias and risk of death among all those infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests. in the ongoing covid-19 epidemic, health authorities must cope with the uncertainty in the risk of death from covid-19, and high-risk individuals should be identified using approaches that can address the abovementioned three problems. although covid-19 involves mostly mild infections among the majority of the general population, the risk of death among young adults is higher than that of seasonal influenza, and elderly with underlying comorbidities require additional care.","Tetsuro Kobayashi, Sung-Mok Jung, Natalie M Linton, Ryo Kinoshita, Katsuma Hayashi, Takeshi Miyama, Asami Anzai, Yichi Yang, Baoyin Yuan, Andrei R Akhmetzhanov, Ayako Suzuki, Hiroshi Nishiura"

1021,A simple model to assess Wuhan lock-down effect and region efforts during COVID-19 epidemic in China Mainland,"abstractsince covid-19 emerged in early december, 2019 in wuhan and swept across china mainland, a series of large-scale public health interventions, especially wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and stay at home movement, have been taken by the government to control the epidemic. based onbaidu migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g february 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-wuhan region (y). one is the sum travelers from wuhan during january 20 to january 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of covid-19 was confirmed and announced on january 20. the other is the ""seed cases"" from wuhan before january 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before january 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. a simple yet effective regression model then was established as follow: y= 70.0916+0.0054×x1+2.3455×x2 (n = 44, r 2 = 0.9330, p<10 -7 ). even the lock-down date only delay or in advance 3 days, the estimated confirmed cases by february 27 in non-wuhan region will increase 35.21% or reduce 30.74% -48.59%. although the above interventions greatly reduced the human mobility, wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and stay at home movement do have a determining effect on the ongoing spread of covid-19 across china mainland. the strategy adopted by china has changed the fast-rising curve of newly diagnosed cases, the international community should learn from lessons of wuhan and experience from china. efforts of 29 provinces and 44 prefecture-level cities against covid-19 were also assessed preliminarily according to the interpretive model. big data has played and will continue playing an important role in public health.","Zheming Yuan, Yi Xiao, Zhijun Dai, Jianjun Huang, Yuan Chen"
232,Estimating the cure rate and case fatality rate of the ongoing epidemic COVID-19,"abstractthe epidemic caused by the novel coronavirus in wuhan at the end of 2019 has become an urgent public event of worldwide concern. however, due to the changing data of the epidemic, there is no scientific estimate of the cure rate and case fatality rate of the epidemic. this study proposes a method to estimate the cure rate and case fatality rate of covid-19. the ratio of cumulative discharges on a given day to the sum of cumulative discharges on a given day and cumulative deaths before j days is used to estimate the cure rate.moreover, the case fatality ratio can also be estimated. after simulation calculations, j is statistically appropriate when it is 8-10, and it is also clinically appropriate. when j is 9, based on the available data, it is inferred that the cure rate of this epidemic is about 93% and the case fatality rate is about 7%. this method of estimating the cure rate can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment in different medical schemes and different regions, and has great value and significance for decision-making in the epidemic. improvement of medical conditions, and rich experience in treatment, patients with covid-19 will be treated more effectively. consequently, the cr will increase, and the cfr will decrease.the authors declare no conflict of interest.","Ying Diao, Xiaoyun Liu, Tao Wang, Xiaofei Zeng, Chen Dong, Yuanming Zhang, Changlong Zhou, Xuan She, Dingfu Liu, Zhongli Hu"

825,Title: COVID-19 Progression Timeline and Effectiveness of Response-to-Spread Interventions across the United States,"abstractmotivated by the rapid upsurge of covid-19 cases in the united states beginning march 2020, we forecast the disease spread and assess the effectiveness of containment strategies by using an estalished network-driven epidemic dynamic model. our model is initialized using the daily counts of active and confirmed covid-19 cases across the us. based on our model predictions for the march 14-16 timeframe, the national epidemic peak could be expected to arrive by early june, corresponding to a daily active count of ≈ 7% of the us population, if no containment plans are implemented. epidemic peaks are expected to arrive in the states of washington and new york by may 21 and 25, respectively. with a modest 25% reduction in covid-19 transmissibility via community-level interventions, the epidemic progression could be delayed by up to 34 days. wholesale interstate traffic restriction is ineffective in delaying the epidemic outbreak, but it does desynchronize the arrival of state-wise epidemic peaks, which could potentially alleviate the burden on limited available medical resources. in addition to forecasting the arrival timeline of the state-wise epidemic peaks, we attempt at informing the optimal timing necessary to enforce community-level interventions. our findings underscore the pressing need for preparedness and timely interventions in states with a large fraction of the vulnerable uninsured and liquid-asset-poverty populations.","Pai Liu, Payton Beeler, Rajan K Chakrabarty"
290,Effective containment explains sub-exponential growth in confirmed cases of recent COVID-19 outbreak in Mainland China,"abstractthe recent outbreak of covid-19 in mainland china is characterized by a distinctive algebraic, subexponential increase of confirmed cases with time during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate. although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in mainland china, the scaling law t µ is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents µ = 2.1 ± 0.3. the universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. we show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. to this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. for a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. quantitative fits to empirical data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. the model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population. these insights may aid the implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced covid-19 secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.","Benjamin F Maier, Dirk Brockmann"
9730,Estimated effectiveness of symptom and risk screening to prevent the spread of COVID-19,"abstracttraveller screening is being used to limit further spread of covid-19 following its recent emergence, and symptom screening has become a ubiquitous tool in the global response. previously, we developed a mathematical model to understand factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent spread of emerging pathogens (gostic et al., 2015) . here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key covid-19 life history and epidemiological parameters. even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people. breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening program. these findings can support evidence-based policy to combat the spread of covid-19, and prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens. gostic et al. elife 2020;9:e55570. doi:  1 of 18 research advance gostic et al. elife 2020;9:e55570.","Katelyn Gostic, Ana Cr Gomez, Riley O Mummah, Adam J Kucharski, James O Lloyd-Smith"

956,Title: Feasibility of controlling 2019-nCoV outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"abstractto assess the viability of isolation and contact tracing to control onwards transmission from imported cases of 2019-ncov.we developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the 2019-ncov outbreak. we used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a 2019 ncov-like pathogen. we considered scenarios that varied in: the number of initial cases; the basic reproduction number r0; the delay from symptom onset to isolation; the probability contacts were traced; the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. we assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. outbreakswere deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total.we measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort.findings: while simulated outbreaks starting with only 5 initial cases, r0 of 1.5 and little transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability, the prospects of controlling an outbreak dramatically dropped with the number of initial cases, with higher r0, and with more transmission before symptom onset. across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an r0 of 1.5 were controllable with under 50% of contacts successfully traced. for r0 of 2.5 and 3.5, more than 70% and 90% of contacts respectively had to be traced to control the majority of outbreaks.the delay between symptom onset and isolation played the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable for lower values of r0. for higher values of r0 and a large initial number of cases, contact tracing and isolation was only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.interpretation: we found that in most scenarios contact tracing and case isolation alone is unlikely to control a new outbreak of 2019-ncov within three months. the probability of control decreases with longer delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. this model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.","Joel Hellewell, Sam Abbott, Amy Gimma, † , Nikos I Bosse, Christopher I Jarvis, Timothy W Russell, James D Munday, Adam J Kucharski, W John Edmunds, Sebastian Funk, Rosalind M Eggo"

147,Forecasting Ultra-early Intensive Care Strain from COVID-19 in England,"abstractthe covid-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented strain on intensive care unit (icu) admission in parts of the world. strategies to create surge icu capacity requires complex local and national service reconfiguration and reduction or cancellation of elective activity. theses measures require time to implement and have an inevitable lag before additional capacity comes on-line.an accurate short-range forecast would be helpful in guiding such di cult, costly and ethically challenging decisions.at the time this work began, cases in england were starting to increase. here we present an attempt at an agile short-range forecast based on published real-time covid-19 case data from the seven national health service commissioning regions in england (east of england, london, midlands, north east and yorkshire, north west, south east and south west). we use a monte carlo approach to model the likely impact of current diagnoses on regional icu capacity over a 14 day horizon. our model is designed to be parsimonious and based on plausible epidemiological data from the literature available.on the basis of the modelling assumptions made, icu occupancy is likely to increase dramatically in the the days following the time of modelling. if the current exponential growth continues, 5 out of 7 commissioning regions will have more critically ill covid-19 patients than there are icu beds within two weeks. despite variable growth in absolute patients, all commissioning regions are forecast to be heavily burdened under the assumptions used.whilst, like any forecast model, there remain uncertainties both in terms of model specification and robust epidemiological data in this early prospective phase, it would seem that surge capacity will be required in the very near future. we hope that our model will help policy decision makers with their preparations. the uncertainties in the data highlight the urgent need for ongoing realtime surveillance to allow forecasts to be constantly updated using high quality local patient-facing data as it emerges.","Jacob Deasy, Emma Rocheteau, Katharina Kohler, Daniel J Stubbs, Pietro Barbiero, Mark Cresham, Pietro Liò, Ari Ercole"
103,Risk estimation and prediction by modeling the transmission of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in mainland China excluding Hubei province,"abstractbackground: in december 2019, an outbreak of novel coronavirus disease emerged in wuhan, china and has swiftly spread to other parts of china and a number of oversea countries. our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self-protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in mainland china excluding hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model.a novel covid-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in china is proposed. we parameterize the model by using the markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) method and estimate the control reproduction number r c , as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio r e (t), of the disease transmission in mainland china excluding hubei province.the estimation outcomes indicate that the control reproduction number is 3.36 (95% ci 3.20-3.64) and r e (t) has dropped below 1 since january 31st, 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the chinese government in mainland china excluding hubei province are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed covid-19 transmission. moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to the spread of disease for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even cause epidemic or outbreak again. by calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we prove that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by april, 2020.to ensure the epidemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated restrict interventions and self-protection measures, including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, etc. people should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep sufficient personal protection until april. if all the above conditions are met, the outbreak is expected to be ended by april in mainland china apart from hubei province.","Hui Wan, † , Jing-An Cui, Guo-Jing Yang"

758,Chinese and Italian COVID-19 outbreaks can be correctly described by a modified SIRD model,"abstractthe covid-19 disease is rapidly spreading in whole globe, affecting millions of people and pushing governments to take drastic measures to contain the outbreaks. the understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic is of great interest for the governments and health authorities that are facing covid-19 outbreaks. the scarce presence of epidemiologic data, due to the still ongoing outbreaks, makes prediction difficult and mainly based on heuristic (fitting) models. however, these models with non-physical based parameters, can only give limited insight in the evolution of the outbreaks. in this work a sird compartmental model was developed to describe and predict the evolution of the chinese and italian outbreaks. exploiting the similarities of the measures taken by the governments to contain the virus and of the total population number of hubei province and italy, the model was tuned on the chinese outbreak (almost extinguished) and by perturbation the italian outbreak was describe and predicted. with this approach the lack of data due to the still ongoing italian epidemic was compensated by the chinese experience, allowing to obtain a sird model for this relatively new covid-19 outbreak. according to the modeling prediction the peak of infection should be on the 28 th of march, with almost 42,000 infected people.",Diego Caccavo
353,Real-Time Estimation of the Risk of Death from Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection: Inference Using Exported Cases,"abstractthe exported cases of 2019 novel coronavirus infection that were confirmed outside of china provide an opportunity to estimate the cumulative incidence and confirmed case fatality risk (ccfr) in mainland china. knowledge of the ccfr is critical to characterize the severity and understand the pandemic potential of covid-19 in the early stage of the epidemic. using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the ccfr and the basic reproduction number-the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a naïve population. we modeled epidemic growth either from a single index case with illness onset on 8 december, 2019 (scenario 1), or using the growth rate fitted along with the other parameters (scenario 2) based on data from 20 exported cases reported by 24 january, 2020. the cumulative incidence in china by 24 january was estimated at 6924 cases (95% ci: 4885, 9211) and 19,289 cases (95% ci: 10,901, 30,158), respectively. the latest estimated values of the ccfr were 5.3% (95% ci: 3.5%, 7.5%) for scenario 1 and 8.4% (95% ci: 5.3%, 12.3%) for scenario 2. the basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.1 (95% ci: 2.0, 2.2) and 3.2 (95% ci: 2.7, 3.7) for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. based on these results, we argued that the current covid-19 epidemic has a substantial potential for causing a pandemic. the proposed approach provides insights in early risk assessment using publicly available data.","Sung-Mok Jung, Andrei R Akhmetzhanov, Katsuma Hayashi, Natalie M Linton, Yichi Yang, Baoyin Yuan, Tetsuro Kobayashi, Ryo Kinoshita, Hiroshi Nishiura"

478,Maximum entropy method for estimating the reproduction number: An investigation for COVID-19 in China,"abstractthe key parameter that characterizes the transmissibility of a disease is the reproduction number . if it exceeds 1, the number of incident cases will inevitably grow over time, and a large epidemic is possible. to prevent the expansion of an epidemic, must be reduced to a level below 1. to estimate the reproduction number, the probability distribution function of the generation interval of an infectious disease is required to be available; however, this distribution is often unknown. in this letter,given the incomplete information for the generation interval, we propose a maximum entropy method to estimate the reproduction number. based on this method, given the mean value and variance of the generation interval, we first determine its probability distribution function and in turn estimate the real-time values of reproduction number of covid-19 in china. by applying these estimated reproduction numbers into the susceptible-infectious-removed epidemic model, we simulate the evolutionary track of the epidemic in china, which is well in accordance with that of the real incident cases.the simulation results predict that china's epidemic will gradually tend to disappear by may 2020 if the quarantine measures can continue to be executed.",Yong Tao

273,The time scale of asymptomatic transmission affects estimates of epidemic potential in the COVID-19 outbreak,"abstractwe assess the impact of asymptomatic transmission on epidemic potential of novel respiratory pathogens (like covid-19) -as measured both by the basic reproduction number (i.e., the expected number of secondary cases generated by an average primary case in a fully susceptible population) and the fraction of new secondary cases attributable to asymptomatic individuals. we show that the impact of asymptomatic transmission depends on generation intervals (i.e., time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person). if the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased. specifically, if asymptomatic cases have a shorter generation interval than symptomatic cases, r 0 will be over-estimated, and if they have a longer generation interval, r 0 will be underestimated. we also show that as the length of asymptomatic generation intervals increase, estimates of the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential phase of the epidemic decrease. our analysis provides a rationale for assessing the duration of asymptomatic cases of covid-19 in addition to their prevalence in the population.","Sang Woo Park, Daniel M Cornforth, Jonathan Dushoff, Joshua S Weitz"

126,Evaluation of the potential incidence of COVID-19 and effectiveness of contention measures in Spain: a data-driven approach,"abstractour society is currently experiencing an unprecedented challenge, managing and containing an outbreak of a new coronavirus disease known as covid-19. while china -where the outbreak started -seems to have been able to contain the growth of the epidemic, different outbreaks are nowadays being detected in multiple countries. much is currently unknown about the natural history of the disease, such as a possible asymptomatic spreading or the role of age in both the susceptibility and mortality of the disease. nonetheless, authorities have to take action and implement contention measures, even if not everything is known. to facilitate this task, we have studied the effect of different containment strategies that can be put into effect. our work specifically refers to the situation in spain as of february 28th, 2020, where a few dozens of cases have been detected. we implemented an seir-metapopulation model that allows tracing explicitly the spatial spread of the disease through data-driven stochastic simulations. our results are in line with the most recent recommendations from the world health organization, namely, that the best strategy is the early detection and isolation of individuals with symptoms, followed by interventions and public recommendations aimed at reducing the transmissibility of the disease, which although not efficacious for disease eradication, would produce as a second order effect a delay of several days in the raise of the number of infected cases.. cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not peer-reviewed) the copyright holder for this preprint .","Alberto Aleta, Yamir Moreno"
403,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"abstractcovid-19 is leading to the implementation of social distancing policies around the world and in the united states, including school closures. the evidence that mandatory school closures reduce cases and ultimately mortality mostly comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the impact of school closure on the healthcare labor supply or the role of the healthcare labor force in reducing the per infection mortality from the pathogen. there is considerable uncertainty of the incremental effect of school closures on transmission and lives saved from school closures. the likely, but uncertain, benefits from school closure need to be weighed against uncertain, and seldom quantified, costs of healthcare worker absenteeism associated with additional child care obligations.we analyze data from the us current population survey to measure the potential child care obligations for us healthcare workers that will need to be addressed if school closures are employed as a social distancing measure. we account for the occupation within the healthcare sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the healthcare labor force that are most exposed to child care obligations from school closures. we use these estimates to identify the critical level for the importance of healthcare labor supply in increasing a patient's covid-19 survival probability that would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality.the us healthcare sector has some of the highest child care obligations in the united states. 29% of healthcare provider households must provide care for children 3-12. assuming non-working adults or a sibling 13 years old or older can provide child care, leaves 15% of healthcare provider households in need of childcare during a school closure, while 7% of healthcare households are single-parent households. we document the substantial variation within the healthcare system. for example, 35% of medical assistants and 31% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aide households have child care obligations, while only 24% of emergency medical personnel have childcare obligations. child care obligations can vary between states by over 10 percentage points. a 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for covid-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker lost by 17.6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. this means that the per infection mortality rate cannot increase from 2% to 2.35% when the healthcare workforce declines by 15%; otherwise, school closures will lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. for school closures to unambiguously provide a net reduction in covid-19 mortality with these parameters, the school closures must reduce cases by over 25%.school closures come with many tradeoffs. setting aside economic costs, school closures implemented to reduce covid-19 spread create unintended childcare obligations, which are particularly large in healthcare occupations. detailed data are provided to help public health officials make informed decisions about the tradeoffs associated with closing schools. the results suggest that it is unclear if the potential all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission. author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.","Jude Bayham, Eli P Fenichel"

237,Tracking and forecasting milepost moments of the epidemic in the early-outbreak: framework and applications to the COVID-19,"abstractbackground: the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus has attracted global attention. in the early stage of the outbreak, the most important question concerns some meaningful milepost moments, including (1) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases decreases, (2) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes smaller than that of the daily removed (recovered and death), (3) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes zero, and (4) the time when the number of patients treated in hospital is zero, which indicates the end of the epidemic. intuitively, the former two can be regarded as two important turning points which indicate the alleviation of epidemic to some extent, while the latter two as two ""zero"" points, respectively.unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to make right and precise prediction due to the limited amount of available data at a early stage of the outbreak.method: to address it, in this paper, we propose a flexible framework incorporating the effectiveness of the government control to forecast the whole process of a new unknown infectious disease in its early-outbreak. specially, we first establish the iconic indicators to characterize the extent of epidemic spread, yielding four periods of the whole process corresponding to the four meaningful milepost moments: two turning points and two ""zero"" points. then we develop the tracking and forecasting procedure with mild and reasonable assumption. finally we apply it to analyze and evaluate the covid-19 using the public available data for mainland china beyond hubei province from the china centers for disease control (cdc) during the period of jan 29th, 2020, to feb 29th, 2020, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed procedure.results: results show that our model can clearly outline the development of the epidemic at a very early stage. the first prediction results on jan 29th reveal that the first and second milepost moments","Huiwen Wang, Yanwen Zhang, Shan Lu, Shanshan Wang"
399,"Healthcare worker absenteeism, child care costs, and COVID-19 school closures: a simulation analysis","abstractschool closures have been enacted as a measure of mitigation during the ongoing covid-19 pandemic due to their ability to reduce transmission. it has been shown that school closures could cause absenteeism amongst healthcare workers with dependent children, but there is a need for detailed high-resolution analysis of the relationship between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism to inform local community preparedness. we provide national-and county-level simulations of school closures and absenteeism across the united states. at the national level, we estimate the projected absenteeism rate to range from 7.5% to 8.6%, and the effectiveness of school closures to range from 172 to 218 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. at the county-level, we find substantial variations of projected absenteeism and school closure effects, ranging from 2.0% to 18.6% absenteeism and 88 to 280 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. we also find significant associations between levels of absenteeism and covid-19 complication factors. we observe from our models that an estimated 98.8% of counties would find it less expensive to provide child care to all healthcare workers with children than to bear the costs of healthcare worker absenteeism during school closures, identifying child care subsidization as a potential solution to help maintain healthcare systems during a pandemic.","Elizabeth T Chin, Benjamin Q Huynh, Nathan C Lo, Trevor Hastie, Sanjay Basu"
2814,Estimation of the reproductive number of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and the probable outbreak size on the Diamond Princess cruise ship: A data-driven analysis,"abstractbackgrounds: up to february 16, 2020, 355 cases have been confirmed as having covid-19 infection on the diamond princess cruise ship. it is of crucial importance to estimate the reproductive number (r0) of the novel virus in the early stage of outbreak and make a prediction of daily new cases on the ship. method: we fitted the reported serial interval (mean and standard deviation) with a gamma distribution and applied ""earlyr"" package in r to estimate the r0 in the early stage of covid-19 outbreak. we applied ""projections"" package in r to simulate the plausible cumulative epidemic trajectories and future daily incidence by fitting the data of existing daily incidence, a serial interval distribution, and the estimated r0 into a model based on the assumption that daily incidence obeys approximately poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. results: the maximum-likelihood (ml) value of r0 was 2.28 for covid-19 outbreak at the early stage on the ship. the median with 95% confidence interval (ci) of r0 values was 2.28 (2.06-2.52) estimated by the bootstrap resampling method. the probable number of new cases for the next ten days would gradually increase, and the estimated cumulative cases would reach 1514 (1384-1656) at the tenth day in the future. however, if r0 value was reduced by 25% and 50%, the estimated total number of cumulative cases would be reduced to 1081 (981-1177) and 758 (697-817), respectively. conclusion: the median with 95% ci of r0 of covid-19 was about 2.28 (2.06-2.52) during the early stage experienced on the diamond princess cruise ship. the future daily incidence and probable outbreak size is largely dependent on the change of r0. unless strict infection management and control are taken, our findings indicate the potential of covid-19 to cause greater outbreak on the ship.","Sheng Zhang, Mengyuan Diao, Wenbo Yu, Lei Pei, Zhaofen Lin, Dechang Chen"
753,Stochastic discrete epidemic modeling of COVID-19 transmission in the Province of Shaanxi incorporating public health intervention and case importation,"abstractbefore the lock-down of wuhan/hubei/china, on january 23 rd 2020, a large number of individuals infected by covid-19 moved from the epicenter wuhan and the hubei province due to the spring festival, resulting in an epidemic in the other provinces including the shaanxi province. the epidemic scale in shaanxi was comparatively small and with half of cases being imported from the epicenter. based on the complete epidemic data including the symptom onset time and transmission chains, we calculate the control reproduction number (1.48-1.69) in xi'an. we could also compute the time transition, for each imported or local case, from the latent, to infected, to hospitalized compartment, as well as the effective reproduction number. this calculation enables us to revise our early deterministic transmission model to a stochastic discrete epidemic model with case importation and parameterize it. our model-based analyses reveal that the newly generated infections decay to zero quickly; the cumulative number of case-driven quarantined individuals via contact tracing stabilize at a manageable level, indicating that the intervention strategies implemented in the shaanxi province have been effective. risk analyses, important for the consideration of ""resumption of work"", show that a large second outbreak is expected if the level of case importation remains at the same level as between january 10 th and february 4 th 2020. however, if the case importation decreases by 30%, 60% and 90%, the second outbreak if happening will be of small-scale assuming contact tracing and quarantine/isolation remain as effective as before. finally, we consider the effects of intermittent inflow with a poisson distribution on the likelihood of multiple outbreaks. we believe the developed methodology and stochastic model provide an important model framework for the evaluation of revising travel restriction rules in the consideration of resuming social-economic activities while managing the disease control with potential case importation.","Sanyi Tang, Biao Tang, Nicola Luigi Bragazzi, Fan Xia, Tangjuan Li, Sha He, Pengyu Ren, Xia Wang, Zhihang Peng, Yanni Xiao, Jianhong Wu"

1031,"Quantifying bias of COVID-19 prevalence and severity estimates in Wuhan, China that depend on reported cases in international travelers","abstractrisk of covid-19 infection in wuhan has been estimated using imported case counts of international travelers, often under the assumption that all cases in travelers are ascertained. recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the covid-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. we therefore used a bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection capacity for other countries compared to that of singapore.we estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% hpdi 22% -64%) of singapore's capacity. equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% hpdi 1.5 -4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, if all countries had had the same detection capacity as singapore. using the second component of the global health security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases relative to singapore among high surveillance locations is 40% (95% hpdi 22% -67%), among intermediate surveillance locations it is 37% (95% hpdi 18% -68%), and among low surveillance locations it is 11% (95% hpdi 0% -42%). using a simple mathematical model, we further find that treating all travelers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travelers in wuhan) can modestly contribute to underestimation of prevalence as well. we conclude that estimates of case counts in wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. : medrxiv preprintterm can be well approximated as we plot this approximation of v given doubling times . v ≈ 1 − e −(r+γ)d aligned with 4 , a range of durations of detectable infection and a range of lengths of stay 2 ( figure 2 ).we estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% ( 95% hpdi 22% -64%) of singapore's capacity. equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% hpdi 1.5 -4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, if all countries had had the same detection capacity as singapore, which leads to 1.8 (95% ci 0.5 -3.4) undetected cases per detected case. the ability to detect imported cases among high surveillance countries is 40% (95% hpdi 22% -67%), among intermediate surveillance countries it is 37% (95% hpdi 18% -68%), and among low surveillance countries it is 11% (95% hpdi 0% -42%). : medrxiv preprint 7in this paper, we have aimed to test two assumptions underlying the estimation of incidence at the epicentre of the sars-cov2 outbreak. the first of these is that the capacity for detection of international imported cases is 100% sensitive and specific across locations. while we know of no reason to doubt specificity of detection, we tested the assumption of perfect sensitivity. based on our previous estimates 5 we assumed singapore has the highest capacity of surveillance with respect to covid-19. we regressed the cumulative cases against wuhan-to-location air travel volume considering singapore to have the greatest detection capacity and estimating the relative underdetection compared to singapore in the remaining 190 locations classified according to the ghs 2 index 9 . while it is unlikely that this index reflects the true ranking of countries for any specific epidemic, such as the current one of covid-19, we assume that it captures different levels of surveillance capacity. we therefore grouped the remaining locations into three big classes high, medium, and low surveillance capacity instead of using exact ranking.we estimated that detection of exported cases from wuhan worldwide is 38% (95% hpdi 22%-64%) as sensitive as it has been in singapore. put another way, this implies that the true number of cases in travelers is at least 2.8 (95% hpdi 1.5 -4.4) times the number that has been detected.equivalently, for each detected case there are at least 1.8 (95% ci 0.5-3.4) undetected cases. if the model is correct, this is an upper bound on the detection frequency because (1) singapore's detection is probably not 100% efficient. singapore had as of 12 february 2020 eight","Rene Niehus, Pablo M De Salazar, Aimee R Taylor, Marc Lipsitch"

809,A data-driven assessment of early travel restrictions related to the spreading of the novel COVID-19 within mainland China,"abstracttwo months after it was firstly reported, the novel coronavirus disease covid-19 has already spread worldwide. however, the vast majority of reported infections have occurred in china. to assess the effect of early travel restrictions adopted by the health authorities in china, we have implemented an epidemic metapopulation model that is fed with mobility data corresponding to 2019 and 2020. this allows to compare two radically different scenarios, one with no travel restrictions and another in which mobility is reduced by a travel ban. our findings indicate that i) travel restrictions are an effective measure in the short term, however, ii) they are ineffective when it comes to completely eliminate the disease. the latter is due to the impossibility of removing the risk of seeding the disease to other regions. our study also highlights the importance of developing more realistic models of behavioral changes when a disease outbreak is unfolding.","Alberto Aleta, Qitong Hu, Jiachen Ye, Peng Ji, Yamir Moreno"

812,Impact of the contact and exclusion rates on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic,"abstractin march 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 originating from wuhan, china, has become pandemic. based on epidemic data from china we constructed and constrained a simple susceptible-infected-infectious-excluded (siie) model. the model is characterized by only three parameters: average incubation period, contact rate r c , and exclusion rate r e . these two rates control the daily multiplication coefficient β describing epidemic growth in its early exponential phase, during which the number of excluded (confirmed) individuals grows as e = e0 exp(α t) with α = ln β. the rates can be modified by non-therapeutic interventions: r c can be reduced by quarantine, while r e can be increased by efficient testing, enabling isolation of infectious individuals. in order to contain exponential epidemic growth, quotient r c /r e has to be reduced to 1. based on the model, we estimate that the quarantine imposed in china on january 23, 2020 resulted in about 50-fold reduction of this quotient, allowing to terminate the exponential growth phase and enter the phase of exponential regression of daily new cases. in contrast, quarantine imposed in northern, most affected, italian provinces on february 21 resulted in about 3-fold reduction of r c /r e and corresponding decrease of β from about 1.5 to about 1.2; further 5-fold reduction is necessary to terminate exponential growth. even higher reduction should take place in france, germany and spain for which β > 1.3 (as of march 10, 2020). considering longer-term dynamics in the case when the initial exponential growth is not contained by quarantine, we analyzed a scenario in which r e decreases in response to the surge of daily new cases which convinces people to isolate themselves. in such case, initial abrupt epidemic growth is followed by a slow decrease over years. this scenario, although economically and socially devastating, grants time to develop, produce, and distribute vaccine.. cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) the copyright holder for this preprint .","Marek Kochańczyk, Frederic Grabowski, Tomasz Lipniacki"

483,Structure of dimeric full-length human ACE2 in complex with B 0 AT1,"abstractangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) is the surface receptor for sars coronavirus (sars-cov), directly interacting with the spike glycoprotein (s protein). ace2 is also suggested to be the receptor for the new coronavirus (2019-ncov), which is causing a serious epidemic in china manifested with severe respiratory syndrome. b 0 at1 (slc6a19) is a neutral amino acid transporter whose surface expression in intestinal cells requires ace2. here we present the 2.9 å resolution cryo-em structure of full-length human ace2 in complex with b 0 at1. the complex, assembled as a dimer of ace2-b 0 at1 heterodimers, exhibits open and closed conformations due to the shifts of the peptidase domains (pds) of ace2. a newly resolved collectrin-like domain (cld) on ace2 mediates homodimerization. structural modelling suggests that the ace2-b 0 at1 complex can bind two s proteins simultaneously, providing important clues to the molecular basis for coronavirus recognition and infection.author/funder. all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.","Renhong Yan, Yuanyuan Zhang, Yaning Li, Lu Xia, Qiang Zhou"

829,Risk Assessment of Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 Outbreaks Outside China,"abstractwe developed a computational tool to assess the risks of novel coronavirus outbreaks outside of china. we estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland china outside the closed areas; (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with china, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions, and the efficacy of entry screening at destination; and (iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number r loc ). we found that in countries with low connectivity to china but with relatively high r loc , the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. countries with high connectivity but low r loc benefit the most from policies that further reduce r loc . countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies. risk assessments were illustrated for selected groups of countries from america, asia, and europe. we investigated how their risks depend on those parameters, and how the risk is increasing in time as the number of cases in china is growing.","Péter Boldog, Tamás Tekeli, Zsolt Vizi, Attila Dénes, Ferenc A Bartha, Gergely Röst"

11218,MINI REVIEW Reservoirs of Porcine Circoviruses: A Mini Review,"abstractporcine circovirus (pcv) is one of the smallest known dna viruses in mammals. at present, pcvs are divided into three species, pcv1, pcv2, and pcv3. pcv1 and pcv2 were found in the 1970s and the 1990s, respectively, whereas pcv3 was discovered recently in 2016. pcv1 does not cause diseases in pigs. however, pcv3, similar to pcv2, is reported to be associated with several swine diseases, including porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (pdns) and reproductive failure. pcvs are very common in domestic pigs as well as wild boars. however, pcvs have been occasionally isolated from non-porcine animals, including ruminants (such as cattle, goats, wild chamois, and roe deers), rodents (such as nmri mice, balb/c mice, black c57 mice, icr mice, mus musculus, and rattus rattus), canines (such as dogs, minks, foxes, and raccoon dogs), insects (such as flies, mosquitoes, and ticks), and shellfish. moreover, pcvs are frequently reported in biological products, including human vaccines, animal vaccines, porcine-derived commercial pepsin products, and many cell lines. pcvs are also abundant in the environment, including water samples and air samples. interestingly, pcv1 and/or pcv2 antibody or antigen has also been detected in sera, stool samples and respiratory swab samples of human, revealing zoonotic potential of pcvs. thus, pcvs inhabit many types of reservoirs. in this review, we summarize the reservoirs of pcvs, and this information would be helpful in understanding the natural circulating status and possible cross-species transmission of pcvs.","Jesus Hernandez, Lorenzo Fraile, Shao-Lun Zhai, Yan-Wei Sun, Yun Xi, Shou-Sheng Lu, Wen-Kang Wei, Dian-Hong Lv, Xiao-Hui Wen, Qi Zhai, Qin-Ling Chen"
8763,"Important roles of dietary taurine, creatine, carnosine, anserine and 4-hydroxyproline in human nutrition and health","abstracttaurine (a sulfur-containing β-amino acid), creatine (a metabolite of arginine, glycine and methionine), carnosine (a dipeptide; β-alanyl-l-histidine), and 4-hydroxyproline (an imino acid; also often referred to as an amino acid) were discovered in cattle, and the discovery of anserine (a methylated product of carnosine; β-alanyl-1-methyl-l-histidine) also originated with cattle. these five nutrients are highly abundant in beef, and have important physiological roles in anti-oxidative and antiinflammatory reactions, as well as neurological, muscular, retinal, immunological and cardiovascular function. of particular note, taurine, carnosine, anserine, and creatine are absent from plants, and hydroxyproline is negligible in many plant-source foods. consumption of 30 g dry beef can fully meet daily physiological needs of the healthy 70-kg adult human for taurine and carnosine, and can also provide large amounts of creatine, anserine and 4-hydroxyproline to improve human nutrition and health, including metabolic, retinal, immunological, muscular, cartilage, neurological, and cardiovascular health. the present review provides the public with the much-needed knowledge of nutritionally and physiologically significant amino acids, dipeptides and creatine in animal-source foods (including beef). dietary taurine, creatine, carnosine, anserine and 4-hydroxyproline are beneficial for preventing and treating obesity, cardiovascular dysfunction, and ageing-related disorders, as well as inhibiting tumorigenesis, improving skin and bone health, ameliorating neurological abnormalities, and promoting well being in infants, children and adults. furthermore, these nutrients may promote the immunological defense of humans against infections by bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses (including coronavirus) through enhancing the metabolism and functions of monocytes, macrophages, and other cells of the immune system. red meat (including beef) is a functional food for optimizing human growth, development and health.",Guoyao Wu

281,Influence of different glycoproteins and of the virion core on SERINC5 antiviral activity,"abstracthost plasma membrane protein serinc5 is incorporated into budding retrovirus particles where it blocks subsequent entry into susceptible target cells. three accessory proteins encoded by diverse retroviruses, hiv-1 nef, eiav s2, and mlv glycogag, each independently disrupt serinc5 antiviral activity, by redirecting serinc5 from the site of virion assembly on the plasma membrane to an internal rab7 + endosomal compartment. pseudotyping retroviruses with particular glycoproteins, e.g., the vesicular stomatitis glycoprotein (vsv g), renders the infectivity of particles resistant to inhibition by virion-associated serinc5. to better understand viral determinants for serinc5-sensitivity, the effect of serinc5 was assessed using hiv-1, mlv, and m-pmv virion cores, pseudotyped with glycoproteins from arenavirus, coronavirus, filovirus, rhabdovirus, paramyxovirus, and orthomyxovirus genera. infectivity of particles, pseudotyped with hiv-1, amphotropic-mlv, or influenza virus glycoproteins, was decreased by serinc5, whether the core was provided by hiv-1, mlv, or m-pmv. particles generated by all three cores, and pseudotyped with glycoproteins from either avian leukosis virus-a, human endogenous retrovirus k (herv-k), ecotropic-mlv, htlv-1, measles morbillivirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus (lcmv), marburg virus, ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (sars-cov), or vsv, were insensitive to serinc5. in contrast, particles pseudotyped with m-pmv, rd114, or rabies virus (rabv)glycoproteins were sensitive to serinc5, but only with particular retroviral cores. resistance to serinc5 by particular glycoproteins did not correlate with reduced serinc5 incorporation into particles or with the route of viral entry. these findings indicate that some non-retroviruses may be sensitive to serinc5 and that, in addition to the viral glycoprotein, the retroviral core influences sensitivity to serinc5.","William E Diehl, Mehmet H Guney, Pyae Phyo Kyawe, Judith M White, Massimo Pizzato, Jeremy Luban"

272,Impacts of Social and Economic Factors on the Transmission of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China *,"abstractthis paper examines the role of various socioeconomic factors in mediating the local and cross-city transmissions of the novel coronavirus 2019 in china. we implement a machine learning approach to select instrumental variables that strongly predict virus transmission among the rich exogenous weather characteristics. our 2sls estimates show that the stringent quarantine, massive lockdown and other public health measures imposed in late january significantly reduced the transmission rate of covid-19. by early february, the virus spread had been contained. while many socioeconomic factors mediate the virus spread, a robust government response since late january played a determinant role in the containment of the virus. we also demonstrate that the actual population flow from the outbreak source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. the results have rich implications for ongoing global efforts in containment of covid-19.","Yun Qiu, Xi Chen, Wei Shi"
2355,Systems-Based Analysis of the Sarcocystis neurona Genome Identifies Pathways That Contribute to a Heteroxenous Life Cycle,"abstractsarcocystis neurona is a member of the coccidia, a clade of single-celled parasites of medical and veterinary importance including eimeria, sarcocystis, neospora, and toxoplasma. unlike eimeria, a single-host enteric pathogen, sarcocystis, neospora, and toxoplasma are two-host parasites that infect and produce infectious tissue cysts in a wide range of intermediate hosts. as a genus, sarcocystis is one of the most successful protozoan parasites; all vertebrates, including birds, reptiles, fish, and mammals are hosts to at least one sarcocystis species. here we sequenced sarcocystis neurona, the causal agent of fatal equine protozoal myeloencephalitis. the s. neurona genome is 127 mbp, more than twice the size of other sequenced coccidian genomes. comparative analyses identified conservation of the invasion machinery among the coccidia. however, many densegranule and rhoptry kinase genes, responsible for altering host effector pathways in toxoplasma and neospora, are absent from s. neurona. further, s. neurona has a divergent repertoire of srs proteins, previously implicated in tissue cyst formation in toxoplasma. systems-based analyses identified a series of metabolic innovations, including the ability to exploit alternative sources of energy. finally, we present an s. neurona model detailing conserved molecular innovations that promote the transition from a purely enteric lifestyle (eimeria) to a heteroxenous parasite capable of infecting a wide range of intermediate hosts.importance sarcocystis neurona is a member of the coccidia, a clade of single-celled apicomplexan parasites responsible for major economic and health care burdens worldwide. a cousin of plasmodium, cryptosporidium, theileria, and eimeria, sarcocystis is one of the most successful parasite genera; it is capable of infecting all vertebrates (fish, reptiles, birds, and mammalsincluding humans). the past decade has witnessed an increasing number of human outbreaks of clinical significance associated with acute sarcocystosis. among sarcocystis species, s. neurona has a wide host range and causes fatal encephalitis in horses, marine mammals, and several other mammals. to provide insights into the transition from a purely enteric parasite (e.g., eimeria) to one that forms tissue cysts (toxoplasma), we present the first genome sequence of s. neurona. comparisons with other coccidian genomes highlight the molecular innovations that drive its distinct life cycle strategies.blazejewski t, nursimulu n, pszenny v, dangoudoubiyam s, namasivayam s, chiasson ma, chessman, tonkin m, swapna ls, hung ss, bridgers j, ricklefs sm, boulanger mj, dubey jp, porcella sf, kissinger jc, howe dk, grigg me, parkinson j. 2015. systems-based analysis of the sarcocystis neurona genome identifies pathways that contribute to a heteroxenous life cycle. mbio 6(1):e02445-14.","Tomasz Blazejewski, Nirvana Nursimulu, Viviana Pszenny, Sriveny Dangoudoubiyam, Sivaranjani Namasivayam, Melissa A Chiasson, Kyle Chessman, Michelle Tonkin, Lakshmipuram S Swapna, Stacy S Hung, Joshua Bridgers, Stacy M Ricklefs, Martin J Boulanger, Jitender P Dubey, Stephen F Porcella, Jessica C Kissinger, Daniel K Howe, Michael E Grigg, John Parkinson, Louis M Weiss, Albert "

3603,viruses Suppression of NF-κB Activity: A Viral Immune Evasion Mechanism,"abstractnuclear factor-κb (nf-κb) is an important transcription factor that induces the expression of antiviral genes and viral genes. nf-κb activation needs the activation of nf-κb upstream molecules, which include receptors, adaptor proteins, nf-κb (iκb) kinases (ikks), iκbα, and nf-κb dimer p50/p65. to survive, viruses have evolved the capacity to utilize various strategies that inhibit nf-κb activity, including targeting receptors, adaptor proteins, ikks, iκbα, and p50/p65. to inhibit nf-κb activation, viruses encode several specific nf-κb inhibitors, including ns3/4, 3c and 3c-like proteases, viral deubiquitinating enzymes (dubs), phosphodegron-like (pdl) motifs, viral protein phosphatase (ppase)-binding proteins, and small hydrophobic (sh) proteins. finally, we briefly describe the immune evasion mechanism of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (hiv-1) by inhibiting nf-κb activity in productive and latent infections. this paper reviews a viral mechanism of immune evasion that involves the suppression of nf-κb activation to provide new insights into and references for the control and prevention of viral diseases.(myd88), toll/il-1 receptor (tir)-containing adaptor-inducing ifnβ (trif), and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (mavs). the innate immune system is the first line of defense against foreign pathogens. nf-κb plays a major role in innate immune responses by inducing antiviral genes, such as interferon (ifn) and ifn-stimulated genes (isg). additionally, nf-κb also promotes viral gene transcription that is harmful to some viruses' latency. therefore, over the long course of evolution, viruses have developed multiple methods that interfere with nf-κb activity to promote viral survival.in this review, we focus on a viral immune evasion mechanism that functions by suppressing nf-κb activation, including targeting receptors, adaptor proteins, ikks,

as interferon (ifn) and ifnstimulated genes (isg). additionally, nf-κb also promotes viral gene transcription that is harmful to some viruses' latency. therefore, over the long course of evolution, viruses have developed multiple methods that interfere with nf-κb activity to promote viral survival.in this review, we focus on a viral immune evasion mechanism that functions by suppressing nf-κb

4763,"cells A Comprehensive Review of Autophagy and Its Various Roles in Infectious, Non-Infectious, and Lifestyle Diseases: Current Knowledge and Prospects for Disease Prevention, Novel Drug Design, and Therapy","abstractautophagy (self-eating) is a conserved cellular degradation process that plays important roles in maintaining homeostasis and preventing nutritional, metabolic, and infection-mediated stresses. autophagy dysfunction can have various pathological consequences, including tumor progression, pathogen hyper-virulence, and neurodegeneration. this review describes the mechanisms of autophagy and its associations with other cell death mechanisms, including apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis, and autosis. autophagy has both positive and negative roles in infection, cancer, neural development, metabolism, cardiovascular health, immunity, and iron homeostasis. genetic defects in autophagy can have pathological consequences, such as static childhood encephalopathy with neurodegeneration in adulthood, crohn's disease, hereditary spastic paraparesis, danon disease, x-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy, and sporadic inclusion body myositis. further studies on the process of autophagy in different microbial infections could help to design and develop novel therapeutic strategies against important pathogenic microbes. this review on the progress and prospects of autophagy research describes various activators and suppressors, which could be used to design novel intervention strategies against numerous diseases and develop therapeutic drugs to protect human and animal health.autophagy is a conserved catabolic process that is involved in cellular homeostasis and is required to maintain normal cellular physiology under stressful conditions  . it overcomes carcinogenic, infectious, degenerative, and deleterious agents to maintain the homeostasis of bodily systems and regulate healthy life processes; thus, its dysregulation is known to cause multiple human diseases     . autophagy can be a selective or non-selective lysosomal degradative process and is activated by stresses such as starvation or rapamycin via regulatory signaling complexes  7] . there are three types of autophagy: macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (cma)  . macroautophagy, referred to as ""autophagy"" from now on, is the major pathway which engulfs large portions of cytoplasm and cellular contents (e.g., long-lived proteins, aggregated proteins, damaged organelles, and intracellular pathogens) into a double-membraned vacuole called the autophagosome, which fuses with lysosomes to form an autolysosome, degrades the autolysosomal contents, and recycles macromolecules for reuse    .microautophagy refers to the process by which lysosomes directly engulf and digest small volumes of cytosolic substrate  13] , whilst cma is induced by physiological stresses such as prolonged starvation  and involves the heat shock cognate protein (hsc70; 71-kda, also known as hspa8) which contains a kferq-like pentapeptide sequence  . the cma pathway delivers target proteins across lysosomal membranes into the lysosomal lumen by interacting with lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2a (lamp-2a)  . hence, cma differs from microautophagy and macroautophagy, as it does not require vesicular trafficking  . regardless of the type, autophagy acts as a cleaning mechanism by removing or degrading unnecessary materials from the body (e.g., proteins, organelles, and microbes) and retaining or maintaining materials (biochemicals, metabolites, and organelles) required for survival, function, and development  6, 16, 17] . the physiological processes of autophagy are governed by numerous cellular regulators (e.g., transcription factors and genes), which can affect homeostatic processing if disturbed by genetic or functional reasons, or overexertion  6, 17] . hence, autophagy defects can affect the pathogenesis of many diseases  .the roles of autophagy have been explored in fields such as health, disease, infection, degeneration, and genetic or lifestyle-acquired diseases     ; however, cancer  22] , microbial infections  21, 23] , and degenerative diseases  24] have been the main focus of autophagy-related research. currently, the roles of autophagy are being explored in diverse fields of study.autophagy plays important roles in cancer metastasis; 4-acetyl-antroquinonol b has been shown to modulate autophagy and prevent the growth of ovarian cancer cells  . clinical studies have revealed higher levels of autophagic flux in distant metastases than in primary tumors  27] ; therefore, autophagy has stage-dependent dual roles in cancer which may facilitate the growth and spread of tumors and affect treatment resistance  . conversely, autophagy has been shown to act as a tumor suppressor during the early and late phases of cancer development  29] by mediating the destruction and removal of carcinogens and cancerous cells, thus enabling the growth and development of healthy cells; however, under disturbed or uncontrolled conditions autophagy can promote cancer growth and dissemination. autophagy is also important in neuronal homeostasis, with its dysfunction associated with numerous neurodegenerative disorders  . pathogenic protein aggregates are a common feature of neurodegenerative disorders, and dysfunctional autophagy is involved in this disease state  . furthermore, mutations in autophagy regulation genes have been shown to induce neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, alzheimer's disease, and familial cells 2019, 8, 674 3 of 64parkinson's disease  24] . these mutations affect different stages of autophagy and thus have different implications for pathogenesis and therapy  .in the modern world, factors such as globalization, liberal trade, climate change, population explosions, public health lapses, immune pressures, and mutations, species jumping, and emerging antibiotic resistance in pathogens have facilitated the spread of various infectious pathogens. in recent years, it has been shown that autophagy has a role in many emerging and re-emerging infectious viral and bacterial diseases that pose significant threats to humans. autophagy initially encounters these infectious pathogens to neutralize them; however, may infections can propagate themselves as persistent intracellular infections and are generally associated with wide outbreaks, epidemics, and highly devastating effects. many viral life cycles are linked with autophagic pathways. the influenza a virus induces autophagosome formation during the early stages of infection and inhibits autophagosomal maturation during the later stages. classical swine fever virus replication is negatively regulated by mtorc1 via autophagy and ires-dependent translation, whilst dengue/zika virus pathogenicity is modulated by antibody-dependent enhancement (ade) which can induce autophagy in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. multimodal necrotic cell death is driven by open reading frame-3a of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)-coronavirus (cov), that triggers the lysosomal damage and dysfunction and therefore transcription of autophagy-related genes is enhanced, whilst endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress in dengue virus (denv) infections results in autophagy activation, viral replication, and pathogenesis. the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potentials by the non-structural protein of crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever (cchf) virus results in apoptosis, whereas paramyxovirus v proteins inhibit constitutively active mda5 proteins to induce autophagy. all of these viral events are related to autophagy and can provide directions for future therapies for chikungunya (chikv), denv, and zika virus (zikv) infections. autophagy has a pivotal role in viral diseases such as bird flu , swine fever , ebola virus disease , zikv infection , sars , chikv infection , denv infection , viral encephalitis , cchf , hendra virus (hev) infection , nipah virus (niv) infection , and the west nile virus (wnv) infection . apart from these, other viral diseases, such as rabies, rotavirus enteritis, and smallpox, have already posed a serious threat to human life -48]. autophagy has also been shown to have a central role in microbial infections , including those caused by listeria , salmonella , shigella , and streptococcus . autophagy can kill or eradicate infectious disease-causing pathogens via the autophagosome or autophagolysosome (autolysosome) to prevent or treat infection  21] ; however, autophagy can also disseminate pathogens during pathogenesis. for example, gut epithelial autophagy can disseminate viruses and bacteria in enteric diseases. therefore, autophagy can play a dual role in infections  21, 54] .in recent years, there has been an increase in the incidence of lifestyle and genetic diseases, such as cancers and neurodegenerative disorders (alzheimer's, parkinson's, and huntington's diseases), which affect the quality of life. advances in science and technology have contributed to overcoming these challenges. novel, alternative, and complementary therapeutic options have been developed, including phages, homing peptides, cytokines, sirna, viral inhibitors, toll-like receptors (tlrs), antibodies, probiotics, herbs, phytomedicines, nanomedicines, and immunomodulatory techniques           . autophagy is the first mechanism to clear endogenous debris and exogenous substances and maintains normal physiological conditions in all eukaryotic cells . besides maintaining homeostasis , autophagy also regulates the development , differentiation , and maturation  of cells, such as endothelial cells , erythrocytes , and adipocytes  72] . these cells are involved in normal physiological (e.g., erythrocytes in respiration), immunological (e.g., mononuclear cells in immunity), metabolic (e.g., adipocytes in fat metabolism), growth (e.g., osteocytes in bone growth), and development (e.g., spermatozoa or ova in reproduction) processes. autophagy is also involved in clearing abnormal protein accumulations and correcting mitochondrial disorganization  74] . the processes of autophagy and apoptosis are interwoven and have been implicated in both microbial infections  75] and cancers  76] . autophagy might play both physiological and pathological roles since it is involved in overcoming cell stresses  77, 78] . considering the numerous cells 2019, 8, 674 4 of 64roles and functions of autophagy in health and disease, we present a comprehensive overview of autophagy, its mechanisms and types, and its associations with other cell death mechanisms. the dual roles of autophagy in infectious diseases (bacterial and viral), tumor suppression/progression, brain development/neurodegeneration, the immune system, and autoimmune diseases, and its other roles have been discussed thoroughly alongside numerous applications of autophagy. we have also summarized the role of autophagy in cardiovascular diseases, iron homeostasis, obesity, diabetes, and diseases caused by defects in autophagy genes. the treatment of autophagy-associated diseases has been described alongside strategies to inhibit or activate autophagy in the prevention and treatment of diseases. this review details the important functions of autophagy in health and disease and its key roles in disease prevention and treatment.autophagy (from the greek words auto, meaning self, and phagy, meaning eating), is an essential, ubiquitous, evolutionarily conserved, catabolic, and self-degradative process that mediates the destruction of cytoplasmic macromolecules to preserve genomic integrity, achieve cell metabolism, and ensure cell survival     . it is a natural regulatory mechanism which retains beneficial substances and removes harmful substances from body, whilst playing a housekeeping role in the elimination of misfolded or aggregated proteins, the eradication of damaged organelles, proteins    , and cancerous materials  , and the elimination of foreign pathogens such as viruses via a degradative lysosomal pathway     .numerous physiobiological roles of autophagy have been identified, such as the disposal of endogenous wastes and exogenous agents to maintain homeostasis; however, disturbing the natural balance of this mechanism can result in pathological consequences  .since it is the primary system for cleaning the body, autophagy can prevent or treat cancer by killing cancerous cells and degrading endogenous or exogenous carcinogens; thus, favoring the development of healthy cells. however, autophagy may have dual roles in cancer as it is involved in stem cell-related resistance to anti-cancer therapy (radioresistance and chemoresistance), metastasis, and tumor recurrence  . as obligate intracellular pathogens, viruses interact with multiple host cell processes for their survival, including metabolism, cellular trafficking, and immunity-related responses  90] . furthermore, autophagy is a major degradative cellular process, with essential roles in many innate and adaptive immune processes    . autophagy also regulates the phosphorylation of p38 and erk1/2 mapks in bv2 microglial cells, required for nitric oxide production  95] . thus, it can affect the activation of neuronal cells by microglia and suppress neurotoxicity. moreover, it can downregulate pro-inflammatory mediators in bv2 microglial cells to rescue them from lps-and α-synuclein-induced neuronal cell death  .autophagy can either be selective or non-selective  . in selective autophagy, cargo is recognized by specific receptors to enable their specific identification, sequestration, and degradation by the autophagosome, whereas in non-specific autophagy, all materials are degraded by the lysosome in a non-specific manner  97] . furthermore, autophagy is known to exist in two forms: constitutive and reactive (induced) autophagy. constitutive autophagy has not been well studied, whereas the latter has been studied extensively and is known to stimulate neurite remodeling in developing brains, thus may be essential during brain development  99] . mice lacking the autophagy proteins atg59 and atg710 display excessive neurodegeneration, indicating that autophagy has physiological importance 0]. numerous factors relating to nutrient deprivation (amino acids and hormones) and build-up of degraded products (proteins) or exogenous agents (pathogens) have been evaluated as induced autophagy stimuli 1, 102] . endogenous and exogenous stimuli induce autophagy for degradation or as a repair mechanism.several stimuli have been shown to induce autophagy, including stress, amino acid starvation 3], rapid declines in trophic factors or hormones (such as sex-based differences) 4], lipid starvation 5], impaired intracellular cholesterol trafficking 6], protein products, and infectious pathogens . cells 2019, 8, 674 5 of 64these stimuli can affect the autophagic function and induce different morphological consequences via diverse signaling pathways; for instance, suppressing phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (pi3k) inhibitors and beclin 1 inhibits the starvation-induced mitochondrial autophagy, but not the neurotoxin (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium)-mediated autophagy 7] 8] 9] . although autophagy was discovered over 50 years ago , its molecular mechanisms were only understood in the late 1990s following a genetic screening in yeast, which revealed mutations in autophagy-related genes. at least 30 yeast autophagy genes (atgs) have been identified, many of which have mammalian cell homologs  .many molecular mechanisms have been explored to reveal the basic processes underlying autophagy. multiple signaling pathways focus on two protein complexes to initiate autophagy, the ulk1 (unc51-like autophagy activating kinase 1) protein kinase complex and the pi3kc3-c1 (class iii phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex i) lipid kinase complex 0] . novel autophagy regulators with rna-related activities have also been shown to be involved in this process 1] . furthermore, upstream signaling pathways common to both autophagy and apoptosis are known to be induced by er stress via signaling molecules such as perk/atf4, ire1α, atf6, and ca 2+ 2] . the details of these mechanisms will shed light on the different forms of autophagy and the numerous intermediates involved.three types of autophagy macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (cma)] are depicted in figure 1 . cells 2019, 8, x for peer review 5 of 65autophagy refers to the process of delivering cytoplasmic or extracellular components to the lysosomes of an animal cell or the vacuoles of plant or yeast cells 3] . the production and maturation of autophagosomes are directly regulated by location, timing, and intensity 4] . cells 2019, 8, 674 6 of 64the phosphoinositide-binding protein, hs1bp3, is a negative regulator of autophagosome biogenesis that regulates the lipid composition and phosphatidic acid (pa) levels of autophagosome precursor membranes 4] . increased levels of systemic autophagy have been reported in caenorhabditis elegans, with hormetic heat stress and heat-shock responsive transcription factor (hsf-1) inducing autophagy to improve the survival and proteostasis of the worm 5] . furthermore, it has been revealed that autophagy is fine-tuned by epigenetic regulation, through histone (coactivator-associated) arginine methyltransferase, carm1, a novel enzyme that follows histone h3r17 dimethylation (histone h3 methylated at arginine 17) which is an important epigenetic marker of starvation-induced autophagy 6] . in addition, the vitamin d receptor has been shown to modulate autophagy in normal mammary glands and luminal breast cancer cells, suggesting a potential therapeutic link between vitamin d levels and breast cancer risk 7] . there are numerous additional endogenous and exogenous factors that modulate autophagy, such as transcription factors, variation in the amount or concentration of various cytoplasmic biochemicals, damaged organelles, exogenous compounds, and pathogens  40, 103] ; therefore, autophagy mechanisms vary. autophagy can be divided into macroautophagy, microautophagy, and cma based on the mechanism by which intracellular materials are delivered into the lysosome for degradation and the molecular structures that target substrates to the lysosomes  8] 9] 0] . although these pathways are mechanistically distinct, they all carry out degradation via the lysosome  118] . most forms of selective autophagy involve the degradation of specific targets; for example, mitophagy (mitochondria), pexophagy (peroxisomes), aggrephagy (protein aggregates), glycophagy (glycogens), lipophagy (lipids), ribophagy (ribosome), xenophagy (pathogens), and er-phagy  121] . autophagy is a novel, evolutionarily conserved function of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eif2α) kinase pathway, which consists of a family of evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinases that regulate stress-induced translational arrest and are targeted by virulence gene products 2] .","Rekha Khandia, Maryam Dadar, Ashok Munjal, Kuldeep Dhama, Kumaragurubaran Karthik, Ruchi Tiwari, Mohd Iqbal Yatoo, Hafiz M N Iqbal, Karam Pal Singh, Sunil K Joshi, Wanpen Chaicumpa, Dayal Upadhayay, Pashu Chikitsa, Vigyan Vishwavidyalay, Evum Go, Anusandhan Sansthan"

6276,"Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease Meningococcal Vaccine for Hajj Pilgrims: Compliance, Predictors, and Barriers","abstractbackground: major intercontinental outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease associated with the hajj occurred in 1987, 2000, and 2001. mandatory meningococcal vaccination for all pilgrims against serogroups a and c and, subsequently, a, c, w, and y controlled the epidemics. overseas pilgrims show excellent adherence to the policy; however, vaccine uptake among domestic pilgrims is suboptimal. this survey aimed to evaluate meningococcal vaccine uptake among hajj pilgrims and to identify key factors affecting this. methods: an anonymous cross-sectional survey was conducted among pilgrims in greater makkah during the hajj in 2017-2018. data on socio-demographic characteristics, vaccination status, cost of vaccination, and reasons behind non-receipt of the vaccine were collected. results: a total of 509 respondents aged 13 to 82 (median 33.8) years participated in the survey: 86% male, 85% domestic pilgrims. only 389/476 (81.7%) confirmed their meningococcal vaccination status; 64 individuals (13.4%), all domestic pilgrims, did not receive the vaccine, and 23 (4.8%) were unsure. among overseas pilgrims, 93.5% certainly received the vaccine (6.5% were unsure) compared to 80.9% of domestic pilgrims (p < 0.01). being employed and having a tertiary qualification were significant predictors of vaccination adherence (odds ratio (or) = 2.2, 95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.3-3.8, p < 0.01; and or = 1.7, ci = 1-2.5, p < 0.05, respectively). those who obtained pre-hajj health advice were more than three times as likely to be vaccinated than those who did not (or = 3.3, ci = 1.9-5.9, p < 0.001). lack of awareness (63.2%, 36/57) and lack of time (15.8%, 9/57) were the most common reasons reported for non-receipt of vaccine. conclusion: many domestic pilgrims missed the compulsory meningococcal vaccine; in this regard, lack of awareness is a key barrier. being an overseas pilgrim (or living at a distance from makkah), receipt of pre-hajj health advice, and employment were predictors of greater compliance with the vaccination policy. opportunities remain to reduce the policy-practice gap among domestic pilgrims. author contributions: conceptualization, g.r.b., t.a., h.a., and h.r.; data curation, a.-m.b.; formal analysis, a.-m.b. and h.r.; project administration, h.r.; supervision, a.k., r.b., and h.r.; validation, a.-m.b., f.a., w.f., trop. med. infect. dis. 2019, 4, 127 11 of 13 and a.a.; visualization, a.-m.b.; writing-original draft, a.-m.b., f.a., w.f., a.a., and a.k.; writing-review and editing","Al-Mamoon Badahdah, Fatimah Alghabban, Wajd Falemban, Abdullah Albishri, Rani Gouri,  Banik, Tariq Alhawassi, Hatem Abuelizz, Marwan A Bakarman, Ameneh Khatami, Robert Booy, Harunor Rashid, M A B , H A ) "

34,Evidence for RNA editing in the transcriptome of 2019 Novel Coronavirus,"abstractthe 2019-ncov outbreak has become a global health risk. editing by host deaminases is an innate restriction process to counter viruses, and it is not yet known whether it operates against 15 coronaviruses. here we analyze rna sequences from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids derived from two wuhan patients. we identify nucleotide changes that may be signatures of rna editing:adenosine-to-inosine changes from adar deaminases and cytosine-to-uracil changes from apobec ones. a mutational analysis of genomes from different strains of human-hosted coronaviridae reveals patterns similar to the rna editing pattern observed in the 2019-ncov 20 transcriptomes. our results suggest that both apobecs and adars are involved in coronavirus genome editing, a process that may shape the fate of both virus and patient.","Salvatore Di Giorgio, Filippo Martignano, Maria Gabriella Torcia, Giorgio Mattiuz, Silvestro G Conticello"

10687,materials Tuning Optical and Granulometric Properties of Gold Nanostructures Synthesized with the Aid of Different Types of Honeys for Microwave-Induced Hyperthermia,"abstractsize-controlled gold nanoparticles (aunps) were synthesised with solutions of three types of polish honeys (lime, multiflower, honeydew) and used in microwave-induced hyperthermia cancer treatment. optical and structural properties of nanostructures were optimized in reference to measurements made by using uv/vis absorption spectrophotometry (uv/vis), transmission electron microscopy (tem) supported by energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (edx), x-ray diffraction (xrd), and attenuated total reflectance fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (atr ft-ir). in addition, concentrations of reducing sugars and polyphenols of honeys applied were determined to reveal the role of these chemical compounds in green synthesis of aunps. it was found that the smallest aunps (20.6 ± 23.3 nm) were produced using a 20% (w/v) multiflower aqueous honey solution and 25 mg·l −1 of au(iii) ions. these aunps were then employed in microwave-induced hyperthermia in a system simulating metastatic tissues. this research illustrated that aunps, as produced with the aid of a multiflower honey solution, could be suitably used for microwave-induced heating of cancer. a fluid containing resultant au nanostructures, as compared to water, revealed facilitated heating and the ability to maintain a temperature of 45 • c required for hyperthermia treatment. materials 2019, 12, 898 2 of 16 for the treatment of metastatic tissues in bones , breast -19], prostate , bladder , brain , and liver . since hyperthermia-based medical procedures rely on the susceptibility of metastatic tissues to be destroyed at elevated temperatures (41-47 • c)  , the increase in the thermal response of the area surrounding a tumour may lead to more effective treatment. in microwave-induced hyperthermia procedures, this is achieved by applying nanofluids (nfs) that usually contain metallic nanostructures with ability to be electromagnetically excited. the most common nfs are fe 3 o 4 -based and are effective in the hyperthermia treatment of bone metastases  . aunps are usually applied in sophisticated procedures of photo-induced hyperthermia due to the plasmonic effect that they cause  . however, based on our previous studies  24] , aunps and ptnps have the extraordinary ability to transfer and accumulate heat, even at ultra-trace concentrations. therefore, it can be hypothesized that the application of functionalized aunps in microwave-induced hyperthermia treatment of cancer may also be very effective.the wide-range of biomedical applications of aunps are related not only to their optical and structural properties, but could also be influenced by toxicity and the chemical composition of reducing and capping agents involved in their synthesis. although many methods were described for the production of aunps, green methods are a promising alternative to well-known chemical methods  . in green synthesis, naturally occurring substances are used as reducing and stabilizing agents during aunps production instead of strong, and usually toxic, chemicals. for that reason, synthesized aunps are biogenic and biocompatible    . there are a variety of natural products reported to be suitable for green synthesis of aunps. accordingly, aqueous leaf extracts prepared from mentha piperita , melissa officinalis , salvia officinalis , terminalia catappa , rosa rugosa , hibiscus rosa sinensis , cinnamomum camphora , eucalyptus globulus , rosmarinus officinalis , ziziphus zizyphus , and plumbago zeylanica , aqueous extracts originated from blackberries, blueberries, and pomegranates , in addition to essential oils collected from eucalyptus globulus , rosmarinus officinalis , anacardium occidentale , curcuma pseudomontana , and some food products, including punica granatum juices , coffee arabica infusions , and cacao powder beverages  were involved in the production of aunps. to the best of our knowledge, only a few research groups have attempted to produce honey-based nfs containing au nanostructures    .honey is obtained by several from about 20,000 species of bees from nectar, pollen, and honeydew  . a large variety of plant species from which bees might collect nectar, pollen, or honeydew, as well as apiary location, and environmental conditions means that several types of honeys can be distinguished  . among them, the most popular are flower, e.g., multi-flower, rapeseed, buckwheat, lime, or heather, and honeydew honeys made from coniferous, leaf, and fir honeydew  . the botanical provenience of the nectar, pollen, and honeydew, as well as environmental pollution, influence the chemical composition of honey  , which can contain more than 400 different compounds  . in addition to water, which content in honey is

530,Estimation of country-level basic reproductive ratios for novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) using synthetic contact matrices,"abstractthe outbreak of novel coronavirus has the potential for global spread, infecting large numbers in all countries. in this case, estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. the basic reproductive ratio (r0) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of contacts through which the disease can spread -with this network determined by socio-demographics including age-structure and household composition. here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from china to inform agedependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. this allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from china. we predict that r0 will be highest across eastern europe and japan, and lowest across africa, central america and south-western asia. this pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly.","Joe Hilton, Matt J Keeling"

4750,molecules Saponins from Chinese Medicines as Anticancer Agents,"abstractsaponins are glycosides with triterpenoid or spirostane aglycones that demonstrate various pharmacological effects against mammalian diseases. to promote the research and development of anticancer agents from saponins, this review focuses on the anticancer properties of several typical naturally derived triterpenoid saponins (ginsenosides and saikosaponins) and steroid saponins (dioscin, polyphyllin, and timosaponin) isolated from chinese medicines. these saponins exhibit in vitro and in vivo anticancer effects, such as anti-proliferation, anti-metastasis, anti-angiogenesis, anti-multidrug resistance, and autophagy regulation actions. in addition, related signaling pathways and target proteins involved in the anticancer effects of saponins are also summarized in this work. of the saponins ginsenoside, saikosaponin, dioscin, polyphyllin, and timosaponin. this work will hopefully serve as a reference for further development of saponins as anticancer agents.triterpenoid saponinsginsenosides are the main active components of ginseng radix (renshen in chinese), which is widespread in northeast china, korea, and japan. it has been used in asian countries for centuries to treat various diseases because of its wide spectrum of pharmacological effects  . additionally, ginsenosides are also found in american ginseng (xiyangshen in chinese). more than 100 ginsenosides have been isolated from ginseng radix and are classified into protopanaxadiol (ppd), protopanaxatriol (ppt), ocotillol, and oleanolic acid types. the main structural difference between the ppd and ppt types is the presence of sugar residues attached to an α-oh at c-6 and the absence of β-oh at c-3 in the ppt moiety  . these compounds have recently received increasing attention due to their anticancer properties. compared with the ppt-type ginsenosides, the ppd-type ginsenosides exhibit stronger anticancer potentials. ginsenoside rg3 ( figure 1a ) and rh2 (figure 1b) are the most well-studied active ppd-type anticancer congeners. other ppd-type ginsenosides, such as ginsenoside rb1 , rb2 , rc , rd , and rk1 , as well as ppt-type ginsenosides such as re  and rf  have also demonstrated anticancer activities with similar mechanisms as those in ginsenoside rg3 or rh2. 2.1.1. ginsenoside rg3 ginsenoside rg3 demonstrates therapeutic effects in vitro and/or in vivo against various tumors, including leukemia , lung cancer , esophageal carcinoma , gastric cancer , colon cancer -28], hepatoma , renal cancer , bladder cancer , breast cancer , ovarian cancer , prostate cancer  and melanoma -39]. moreover, combination therapy of ginsenoside rg3 with other chemotherapeutic agents has also become the focus of recent research. ginsenoside rg3 reinforces the anticancer effects when combined with cyclophosphamide -42], capecitabine , docetaxel , gemcitabine , cisplatin , doxorubicin , verapamil , and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (trail)  . additionally, ginsenoside rg3 sensitizes cancer cells to γ-radiation by targeting the nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-κb) pathway , vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf), and hif-1α  50] . in vivo studies have suggested that ginsenoside rg3 not only reduces tumor growth, but also enhances cellular immunity , prolongs the survival time, and improves the quality of life of mice with tumors . ginsenoside rg3 treatment affects a broad range of signaling pathways and factors, including downregulation or deactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) , inactivation of nf-κb by reducing phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (erk) and protein kinase b (akt) , suppression of nf-κb/p65 signaling pathway , modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapk) , down-regulation of wnt/β-catenin signaling , inhibition of cxc receptor 4 (cxcr4) , down-regulation of aqp1 expression through p38 pathway , down-regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k)/akt family proteins and inhibitor of apoptosis protein (iap) family proteins , reduction of histone deacetylase 3 expression and enhancement of p53 acetylation , inhibition of autophagy , suppression of anoikis resistance , and suppression of warburg effect through signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3)/hk2 pathway . furthermore, the anticancer mechanisms of ginsenoside rg3 is related to the alteration of bcl-2 family proteins expression, including downregulation of bcl-2 and bcl-xl, upregulation or activation of bax  60] , and activation of caspase cascade  62] . another study recently found that ginsenoside rg3 can inhibit the growth and survival of gastric cancer cells via blockade of the activity of transient receptor potential melastatin 7 channel , which is essential for cell survival that make it a potential target for gastric cancer treatment. moreover, ginsenoside rg3 also exhibits other anticancer properties, such as declination of fucosyltransferase iv","Xiao-Huang Xu, Ting Li, Chi Man, Vivienne Fong, Xiuping Chen, Xiao-Jia Chen, Yi-Tao Wang, Ming-Qing Huang,

471,The feasibility of convalescent plasma therapy in severe COVID- 19 patients: a pilot study,"abstractcurrently, there are no approved specific antiviral agents for 2019 novel coronavirus disease . in this study, ten severe patients confirmed by real-time viral rna test were enrolled prospectively. one dose of 200 ml convalescent plasma (cp) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. the primary endpoint was the safety of cp transfusion. the second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 days after cp transfusion. the median time from onset of illness to cp transfusion was 16.5 days. after cp transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). the clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 days. several parameters tended to improve as compared to pre-transfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65×10 9 /l vs. 0.76×10 9 /l) and decreased c-reactive protein (55.98 mg/l vs. 18.13 mg/l). radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesionswithin 7 days. the viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. no severe adverse effects were observed. this study showed cp therapy was welltolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe covid-19 cases. the optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of cp therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.covid-19is currently a big threat to global health. however, no specific antiviral agents are available for its treatment. in this work, we explored the feasibility of convalescent plasma (cp) transfusion to rescue severe patients. the results from 10 severe adult cases showed that one dose (200 ml) of cp was welltolerated and could significantly increase or maintain the neutralizing antibodies at a high level, leading to disappearance of viremia in 7 days. meanwhile, clinical symptoms and paraclinical criteria rapidly improved within 3 days. radiological examination all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission. author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.","Kai Duan, Bende Liu, Cesheng Li, Huajun Zhang, Ting Yu, Jieming Qu, Min Zhou, Li Chen, Shengli Meng, Yong Hu, Cheng Peng, Mingchao Yuan, Jinyan Huang, Zejun Wang, Jianhong Yu, Xiaoxiao Gao, Dan Wang, Xiaoqi Yu, Li Li, Jiayou Zhang, Xiao Wu, Bei Li, Yanping Xu, Wei Chen, Yan Peng, Yeqin Hu, Lianzhen Lin, Xuefei Liu, Shihe Huang, Zhijun Zhou, Lianghao Zhang, Yue Wang, Zhi Zhang, Kun Deng, Zhiwu Xia, Qin Gong, Wei Zhang, Xiaobei Zheng, Ying Liu, Huichuan Yang, Dongbo Zhou, Ding Yu, Jifeng Hou, Zhengli Shi, Saijuan Chen, Chen 10+, Xinxin Zhang, Xiaoming Yang, Zhu Chen"
5946,"MPLEx: a Robust and Universal Protocol for Single-Sample Integrative Proteomic, Metabolomic, and Lipidomic Analyses","abstractintegrative multi-omics analyses can empower more effective investigation and complete understanding of complex biological systems. despite recent advances in a range of omics analyses, multi-omic measurements of the same sample are still challenging and current methods have not been well evaluated in terms of reproducibility and broad applicability. here we adapted a solvent-based method, widely applied for extracting lipids and metabolites, to add proteomics to mass spectrometry-based multi-omics measurements. the metabolite, protein, and lipid extraction (mplex) protocol proved to be robust and applicable to a diverse set of sample types, including cell cultures, microbial communities, and tissues. to illustrate the utility of this protocol, an integrative multi-omics analysis was performed using a lung epithelial cell line infected with middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which showed the impact of this virus on the host glycolytic pathway and also suggested a role for lipids during infection. the mplex method is a simple, fast, and robust protocol that can be applied for integrative multi-omic measurements from diverse sample types (e.g., environmental, in vitro, and clinical).in systems biology studies, the integration of multiple omics measurements (i.e., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics) has been shown to provide a more complete and informative view of biological pathways. thus, the prospect of extracting different types of molecules (e.g., dnas, rnas, proteins, and metabolites) and performing multiple omics measurements on single samples is very attractive, but such studies are challenging due to the fact that the extraction conditions differ according to the molecule type. here, we adapted an organic solvent-based extraction method that demonstrated broad applicability and robustness, which enabled comprehensive proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics analyses from the same sample.m ulti-omic measurements and the integration of the resulting information can transform our understanding of complex biological systems (1-4). multiple layers of information (dnas, rnas, proteins, metabolites, and lipids) can provide key insights regarding regulatory networks that are often overlooked using a single type of measurement (e.g., only proteomics or metabolomics). for instance, changes in levels of a","Ernesto S Nakayasu, Carrie D Nicora, Amy C Sims, Kristin E Burnum-Johnson, Young-Mo Kim, Jennifer E Kyle, Melissa M Matzke, Anil K Shukla, Rosalie K Chu, Athena A Schepmoes, Jon M Jacobs, Ralph S Baric, Bobbie-Jo Webb-Robertson, Richard D Smith, Thomas O Metz, ; , Nakayasu Es, Nicora Cd, Sims Ac, Burnum-Johnson Ke, Y-M Kim, Kyle Je, Matzke Mm, Shukla Ak, Chu Rk, Schepmoes Aa, Jacobs Jm, Baric Rs, Webb-Robertson B-J , Smith Rd"

12264,Epidemiology of Deltacoronaviruses (δ-CoV) and Gammacoronaviruses (γ-CoV) in Wild Birds in the United States,"abstractporcine deltacoronavirus (δ-cov) is the object of extensive research in several countries including the united states. in contrast, the epidemiology of δ-covs in wild birds in the us is largely unknown. our aim was to comparatively assess the prevalence of δand γ-covs in wild migratory terrestrial and aquatic birds in arkansas, illinois, indiana, maryland, mississippi, missouri, ohio, tennessee and wisconsin. a total of 1236 cloacal/fecal swabs collected during the period 2015-2018 were tested for γand δ-covs using genus-specific reverse transcription-pcr assays. a total of 61 (4.99%) samples were γ-cov positive, with up to 29 positive samples per state. in contrast, only 14 samples were positive for δ-cov (1.14%) with only 1-4 originating from the same state. thus, unlike previous reports from asia, γ-covs are more prevalent than δ-covs in the us, suggesting that δ-covs may spread in birds with lower efficiency. this may indicate δ-cov emerging status and incomplete adaptation to new host species limiting its spread. phylogenetic analysis of the partial n gene revealed that the newly identified δ-cov strains were most closely related to the hku20 (wigeon) strain. further studies are necessary to investigate the role of aquatic bird δ-covs in the epidemiology of δ-covs in swine and terrestrial birds. viruses 2019, 11, 897 2 of 11and mammals including pigs  . porcine deltacoronavirus (pdcov) emerged in the us in 2014 as a new enteropathogenic cov causing diarrhea, vomiting, and mortality in neonatal piglets, resulting in economic losses to the swine industry  5] . its origin is unknown, but it is hypothesized that it may have spilled over from an avian host.δ-cov and γ-cov are co-circulating in wild avian species, but their epidemiology (prevalence and diversity) differ         . in a screening study of 918 wild australian birds, 141 of them tested positive for covs. after sequencing, δ-cov was detected in pacific black ducks, curlew sandpiper, red-necked stints, ruddy turnstones, and pied herons  . however, γ-cov (80% of sequenced samples) was identified more frequently than δ-cov (20% of sequenced samples)  . γ-cov was also detected in quails and pheasants in italy  . rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) analyses found that quail were also infected with δ-cov . wild birds harbor genetically diverse δ-cov with some of them potentially transmittable to pigs  . a previous report from brazil showed that δ-covs were detected in two species of wild terrestrial birds, purple-breasted-parrot and plain parakeet. these avian covs were monophyletically related to covs from sparrow (spacov hku19) and swine (porcov hku15), which were also found to be δ-cov. this information supports the hypothesis that δ-cov can cross inter-species barriers, with the potential to transmit from birds to swine  .previous studies of covs in hong kong reported three novel covs in bulbuls (bucov hku11), thrushes (thcov hku12) and munias (mucov hku13), which were hypothesized to belong to the novel genus δ-cov . these three novel δ-covs clustered with a δ-cov detected in asian leopard cats ; however, further studies are necessary to understand interspecies transmission from birds . in a surveillance study in hong kong and cambodia, δ-covs were found in different wild aquatic birds: gray herons, pond herons, great cormorants, black-faced spoonbills, and several duck species  . δ-covs do not cause severe illness in birds, leading to their endemic nature in the avian population  . in a screening study for δ-covs in china, none were found in asian leopard cats, bats, domestic cats, cattle, chickens, dogs, humans, monkeys, and rodents  . the investigators discovered seven novel δ-covs in pigs and wild birds (white-eye, sparrow, magpie robin, night heron, wigeon, and common moorhen)  . genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis showed that avian and swine δ-covs had similar genome characteristics and structures  . similarly, a recent study in the us described a novel sparrow δ-cov that clustered together with pdcov  and other terrestrial, but aquatic bird δ-covs.in brazil, screening revealed the presence of covs in vinaceous-breasted amazon and plain parakeet, that were closely related to δ-covs from birds (spacov hku17) and swine (porcov). this emphasizes the increased risk for direct interspecies transmission and that in contrast to waterfowl, terrestrial birds may act as intermediate hosts and are commonly found in the sites of bird-swine co-mingling . in finland, two different avian δ-cov strains from lesser black-backed gull and black-headed gull were detected which shared 83% and 85% nucleotide identity with avian and mammalian δ-covs, respectively  .in summary, recently identified δ-covs are emerging globally that possess high genetic and antigenic plasticity. porcine δ-cov is being studied extensively in the us and elsewhere  5] . in contrast, the diversity and epidemiology of δ-covs in wild birds in the us are largely unknown. the association of porcine δ-cov with enteric disease in pigs and its continuous spread underscore an urgent need to further investigate the mechanisms of its persistence and spread. extensive epidemiological studies are needed to evaluate δ-cov prevalence in avian species, swine farms, pig-bird comingling sites and high pig-traffic sites such as abattoirs, assembly yards and truck washes. in this study, we investigated the prevalence of δand γ-covs in wild migratory terrestrial and aquatic birds in arkansas, illinois, indiana, maryland, mississippi, missouri, ohio, tennessee, and wisconsin. author contributions: conceptualization, a.n.v.;

7712,What Synthesis Methodology Should I Use? A Review and Analysis of Approaches to Research Synthesis,"abstractbackground: when we began this process, we were doctoral students and a faculty member in a research methods course. as students, we were facing a review of the literature for our dissertations. we encountered several different ways of conducting a review but were unable to locate any resources that synthesized all of the various synthesis methodologies. our purpose is to present a comprehensive overview and assessment of the main approaches to research synthesis. we use 'research synthesis' as a broad overarching term to describe various approaches to combining, integrating, and synthesizing research findings. methods: we conducted an integrative review of the literature to explore the historical, contextual, and evolving nature of research synthesis. we searched five databases, reviewed websites of key organizations, hand-searched several journals, and examined relevant texts from the reference lists of the documents we had already obtained. results: we identified four broad categories of research synthesis methodology including conventional, quantitative, qualitative, and emerging syntheses. each of the broad categories was compared to the others on the following: key characteristics, purpose, method, product, context, underlying assumptions, unit of analysis, strengths and limitations, and when to use each approach. conclusions: the current state of research synthesis reflects significant advancements in emerging synthesis studies that integrate diverse data types and sources. new approaches to research synthesis provide a much broader range of review alternatives available to health and social science students and researchers.research synthesis is the overarching term we use to describe approaches to combining, aggregating, integrating, and synthesizing primary research findings. each synthesis methodology draws on different types of findings depending on the purpose and product of the chosen synthesis (see additional file 1).based on our current knowledge of the literature, we identified these approaches to include in our review: systematic review, meta-analysis, qualitative meta-synthesis, meta-narrative synthesis, scoping review, rapid review, realist synthesis, concept analysis, literature review, and integrative review. our first step was to divide the synthesis types among the research team. each member did a preliminary search to identify key texts. the team then met to develop search terms and a framework to guide the review.over the period of 2008 to 2012 we extensively searched the literature, updating our search at several time points, not restricting our search by date. the dates of texts reviewed range from 1967 to 2015. we used the terms above combined with the term ""method* (e.g., ""realist synthesis"" and ""method*) in the database health source: academic edition (includes medline and cinahl). this search yielded very few texts on some methodologies and many on others. we realized that many documents on research synthesis had not been picked up in the search. therefore, we also searched google scholar, pubmed, eric, and social science index, as well as the websites of key organizations such as the joanna briggs institute, the university of york centre for evidence-based nursing, and the cochrane collaboration database. we hand searched several nursing, social science, public health and health policy journals. finally, we traced relevant documents from the references in obtained texts.we included works that met the following inclusion criteria: (1) published in english;(2) discussed the history of research synthesis; (3) explicitly described the approach and specific methods; or (4) identified issues, challenges, strengths and limitations of the particular methodology. we excluded research reports that resulted from the use of particular synthesis methodologies unless they also included criteria 2, 3, or 4 above.based on our search, we identified additional types of research synthesis (e.g., meta-interpretation, best evidence synthesis, critical interpretive synthesis, meta-summary, grounded formal theory). still, we missed some important developments in meta-analysis, for example, identified by the journal's reviewers that have now been discussed briefly in the paper. the final set of 197 texts included in our review comprised theoretical, empirical, and conceptual papers, books, editorials and commentaries, and policy documents.in our preliminary review of key texts, the team inductively developed a framework of the important elements of each method for comparison. in the next phase, each text was read carefully, and data for these elements were extracted into a table for comparison on the points of: key characteristics, purpose, methods, and product; see additional file 1). once the data were grouped and extracted, we synthesized across categories based on the following additional points of comparison: complexity of the process, degree of systematization, consideration of context, underlying assumptions, unit of analysis, and when to use each approach. in our results, we discuss our comparison of the various synthesis approaches on the elements above.","Kara Schick-Makaroff, Marjorie Macdonald, Marilyn Plummer, Judy Burgess, Wendy Neander"
632,Demographic science aids in understanding the spread and fatality rates of COVID-19,"abstractgovernments around the world must rapidly mobilize and make difficult policy decisions to mitigate the covid-19 pandemic. because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. we examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in italy and south korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. this powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for covid-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider both the age composition of local and national contexts as well as the social connectedness of older and younger generations. we also call for countries to provide case and fatality data disaggregated by age and sex to improve real-time targeted nowcasting.","Jennifer Beam Dowd, Valentina Rotondi, Liliana Andriano, David M Brazel, Xuejie Ding, Yan Liu, Melinda C Mills"
11958,Identification of Novel Natural Products as Effective and Broad-Spectrum Anti-Zika Virus Inhibitors,"abstractzika virus (zikv) infection during pregnancy leads to severe congenital zika syndrome, which includes microcephaly and other neurological malformations. no therapeutic agents have, so far, been approved for the treatment of zikv infection in humans; as such, there is a need for a continuous effort to develop effective and safe antiviral drugs to treat zikv-caused diseases. after screening a natural product library, we have herein identified four natural products with anti-zikv activity in vero e6 cells, including gossypol, curcumin, digitonin, and conessine. except for curcumin, the other three natural products have not been reported before to have anti-zikv activity. among them, gossypol exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity against almost all 10 zikv strains tested, including six recent epidemic human strains. the mechanistic study indicated that gossypol could neutralize zikv infection by targeting the envelope protein domain iii (ediii) of zikv. in contrast, the other natural products inhibited zikv infection by targeting the host cell or cell-associated entry and replication stages of zikv. a combination of gossypol with any of the three natural products identified in this study, as well as with bortezomib, a previously reported anti-zikv compound, exhibited significant combinatorial inhibitory effects against three zikv human strains tested. importantly, gossypol also demonstrated marked potency against all four serotypes of dengue virus (denv) human strains in vitro. taken together, this study indicates the potential for further development of these natural products, particularly gossypol, as the lead compound or broad-spectrum inhibitors against zikv and other flaviviruses, such as denv. and fetal death, have been approved. this calls for the development of safe and effective therapeutic agents against zikv infection in humans.the genome of zikv encodes a polyprotein, which is then cleaved by cellular and viral proteases to form three structural proteins, including capsid (c), precursor of membrane/membrane (prm/m), and envelope (e), as well as seven nonstructural proteins, including ns1, ns2a, ns2b, ns3, ns4a, ns4b, and ns5  . the life cycle of zikv involves several crucial steps, including viral attachment to target cell receptors or cofactors, receptor-mediated endocytosis (viral entry), virus-endosomal membrane fusion, and postentry or post-translation stages  10] . in this life cycle, e protein plays a key role in viral entry into target cells and subsequent fusion of virus and cell membranes; thus, zikv e protein serves as an important therapeutic target against zikv infection  12] .in addition to zikv, other flaviviruses, such as denv, also cause significant problems for humans. four antigenic serotypes of denv (denv-1-4) lead to dengue disease (dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, or dengue shock syndrome), with cases increasing annually  14] . therefore, the development of broad-spectrum antiviral inhibitors will be useful for the treatment of infections caused by zikv and other flaviviruses, including denv.in this study, we have identified four anti-zikv inhibitors after screening a natural product library, three of which (gossypol, digitonin, and conessine) have not been reported previously against zikv infection. we have demonstrated the broad-spectrum activity of these natural products, particularly gossypol, against multiple zikv strains and all four denv serotypes. we have further identified the mechanisms of action and potential targets of these natural products and revealed the enhanced combinatorial effects of gossypol with other natural products in inhibiting zikv infection. overall, our study opens the door for further exploration and development of the identified natural products as the lead compound or broad-spectrum anti-zikv and anti-flavivirus inhibitors.materials and methodsvero e6 and llc-mk2 cells (atcc, manassas, va, usa) were maintained in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (dmem) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum (fbs) and penicillin and streptomycin (p/s). c6/36 cells (atcc) were maintained in eagle's minimal essential medium (emem) supplemented with 5% fbs and p/s. zikv strains, including human strains pan2016 (2016/panama), r116265 (2016/mexico), pan2015 (2015/panama), flr (2015/colombia), r103451 (2015/honduras), prvabc59 (2015/puerto rico), plcal_zv (2013/thailand), and ibh 30656 (1968/nigeria), mosquito strain mex 2-81 (2016/mexico), and rhesus macaque strain mr 766 (1947/uganda) (figure 1), were used in the studies. these zikv strains were cultured in vero e6 cells, and viral titers were detected by a standard plaque-forming assay . denv human strains, including type 1: denv-1-v1792 (2007/vietnam), type 2: denv-2-v594 (2006/puerto rico), type 3: denv-3-v1043 (2006/puerto rico), and type 4: denv-4-pr 06-65-740 (2006/puerto rico) (figure 1), were cultured in c6/36 cells, and the viral titers were determined by plaque-forming assay.","Yaning Gao, Wanbo Tai, Ning Wang, Xiang Li, Shibo Jiang, Asim K Debnath, Lanying Du, Shizhong Chen"
12571,Article 189 1 Citation: Yandamuri SS and Lane TE (2016) Imaging Axonal Degeneration and Repair in Preclinical Animal Models of Multiple Sclerosis,"abstractmultiple sclerosis (ms) is a central nervous system (cns) disease characterized by chronic neuroinflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage. infiltration of activated lymphocytes and myeloid cells are thought to be primarily responsible for white matter damage and axonopathy. over time, this neurologic damage manifests clinically as debilitating motor and cognitive symptoms. existing ms therapies focus on symptom relief and delay of disease progression through reduction of neuroinflammation. however, long-term strategies to remyelinate, protect, or regenerate axons have remained elusive, posing a challenge to treating progressive forms of ms. preclinical mouse models and techniques, such as immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and genomic and proteomic analysis have provided advances in our understanding of discrete time-points of pathology following disease induction. more recently, in vivo and in situ two-photon (2p) microscopy has made it possible to visualize continuous real-time cellular behavior and structural changes occurring within the cns during neuropathology. research utilizing 2p imaging to study axonopathy in neuroinflammatory demyelinating disease has focused on five areas: (1) axonal morphologic changes, (2) organelle transport and health, (3) relationship to inflammation, (4) neuronal excitotoxicity, and (5) regenerative therapies. 2p imaging may also be used to identify novel therapeutic targets via identification and clarification of dynamic cellular and molecular mechanisms of axonal regeneration and remyelination. here, we review tools that have made 2p accessible for imaging neuropathologies and advances in our understanding of axonal degeneration and repair in preclinical models of demyelinating diseases.abbreviations: 2d2, mog peptide 35-55 tcr transgenic; app, amyloid precursor protein; atp, adenosine triphosphate; certn-l15, troponin c expressing ca 2+ sensing transgenic animal; cfp, cyan fluorescent protein; eae, experimental autoimmune/allergic encephalomyelitis; eb3, end-binding protein 3; fad, focal axonal degeneration; fret, förster resonance energy transfer; geci, genetically encoded ca 2+ indicator; gfp, green fluorescent protein; jhmv, john howard mueller strain of murine hepatitis virus; lfb, luxol fast blue; mhc, major histocompatibility complex; mog, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein; mri, magnetic resonance imaging; mrs, magnetic resonance spectroscopy; ms, multiple sclerosis; nawm, normal appearing white matter; npc, neural precursor cell; ot-2, ovalbumin peptide 323-339 tcr transgenic-binding mhc class ii; plp, proteolipid protein (promoter for mature oligodendrocytes); rag, recombination activating-gene; rfp, red fluorescent protein; rns, reactive nitrogen species; ros, reactive oxygen species; smi31, sternberger monoclonal incorporated monoclonal antibody 31; smi32, sternberger monoclonal incorporated monoclonal antibody 32; tcr, t-cell receptor; thy1, thymocyte antigen 1 (promoter for neuron subset); tmev, theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus; tn-xxl, troponin c expressing ca 2+ sensing transgenic animal; xfp, ""x"" fluorescent protein (any spectral variant of gfp); yfp, yellow fluorescent protein.","Masaaki Murakami, Hideki Ogura, Yasunobu Arima, Thomas E Lane, Soumya S Yandamuri"
4235,Genetic Characterization of the Belgian Nephropathogenic Infectious Bronchitis Virus (NIBV) Reference Strain B1648,"abstractthe virulent nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (nibv) strain b1648 was first isolated in 1984, in flanders, belgium. despite intensive vaccination, b1648 and its variants are still circulating in europe and north africa. here, the full-length genome of this belgian nibv reference strain was determined by next generation sequencing (ngs) to understand its evolutionary relationship with other ibv strains, and to identify possible genetic factors that may be associated with the nephropathogenicity. thirteen open reading frames (orfs) were predicted in the b1648 strain (5 1 utr-1a-1b-s-3a-3b-e-m-4b-4c-5a-5b-n-6b-3 1 utr). orfs 4b, 4c and 6b, which have been rarely reported in literature, were present in b1648 and most of the other ibv complete genomes. according to phylogenetic analysis of the full-length genome, replicase transcriptase complex, spike protein, partial s1 gene and m protein, b1648 strain clustered with the non-massachusetts type strains nga/a116e7/2006, ukr 27-11, qx-like ita/90254/2005, qx-like ck/swe/0658946/10, tn20/00, rf-27/99, rf/06/2007 and slo/266/05. based on the partial s1 fragment, b1648 clustered with the strains tn20/00, rf-27/99, rf/06/2007 and slo/266/05 and, further designated as b1648 genotype. the full-length genome of b1648 shared the highest sequence homology with ukr 27-11, gray, jmk, and nga/a116e7/2006 (91.2% to 91.6%) and was least related with the reference beaudette and massachusetts strains (89.7%). nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses indicated that b1648 strain may have played an important role in the evolution of ibv in europe and north africa. further, the nephropathogenicity determinants might be located on the 1a, spike, m and accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 4b, 4c, 5a, 5b and 6b). overall, strain b1648 is distinct from all the strains reported so far in europe and other parts of the world.","Vishwanatha R A P Reddy, Sebastiaan Theuns, Inge D M Roukaerts, Mark Zeller, Jelle Matthijnssens, Hans J Nauwynck"
8618,pharmaceutics Recent Advances in Nanovaccines Using Biomimetic Immunomodulatory Materials,"abstractthe development of vaccines plays a vital role in the effective control of several fatal diseases. however, effective prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines have yet to be developed for completely curing deadly diseases, such as cancer, malaria, hiv, and serious microbial infections. thus, suitable vaccine candidates need to be designed to elicit appropriate immune responses. nanotechnology has been found to play a unique role in the design of vaccines, providing them with enhanced specificity and potency. nano-scaled materials, such as virus-like particles, liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles (nps), and protein nps, have received considerable attention over the past decade as potential carriers for the delivery of vaccine antigens and adjuvants, due to their beneficial advantages, like improved antigen stability, targeted delivery, and long-time release, for which antigens/adjuvants are either encapsulated within, or decorated on, the np surface. flexibility in the design of nanomedicine allows for the programming of immune responses, thereby addressing the many challenges encountered in vaccine development. biomimetic nps have emerged as innovative natural mimicking biosystems that can be used for a wide range of biomedical applications. in this review, we discuss the recent advances in biomimetic nanovaccines, and their use in anti-bacterial therapy, anti-hiv therapy, anti-malarial therapy, anti-melittin therapy, and anti-tumor immunity.","Veena Vijayan, Adityanarayan Mohapatra, Saji Uthaman, In-Kyu Park"

5275,Emodin Inhibits EBV Reactivation and Represses NPC Tumorigenesis,"abstractnasopharyngeal carcinoma (npc) is a unique malignancy derived from the epithelium of the nasopharynx. despite great advances in the development of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, relapse and metastasis in npc patients remain major causes of mortality. evidence accumulated over recent years indicates that epstein-barr virus (ebv) lytic replication plays an important role in the pathogenesis of npc and inhibition of ebv reactivation is now being considered as a goal for the therapy of ebv-associated cancers. with this in mind, a panel of dietary compounds was screened and emodin was found to have potential anti-ebv activity. through western blotting, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometric analysis, we show that emodin inhibits the expression of ebv lytic proteins and blocks virion production in ebv-positive epithelial cell lines. in investigating the underlying mechanism, reporter assays indicated that emodin represses zta promoter (zp) and rta promoter (rp) activities, triggered by various inducers. mapping of the zp construct reveals that the sp1 binding region is important for emodin-triggered repression and emodin is shown to be able to inhibit sp1 expression, suggesting that it likely inhibits ebv reactivation by suppression of sp1 expression. moreover, we also show that emodin inhibits the tumorigenic properties induced by repeated ebv reactivation, including micronucleus formation, cell proliferation, migration, and matrigel invasiveness. emodin administration also represses the tumor growth in mice which is induced by ebv activation. taken together, our results provide a potential chemopreventive agent in restricting ebv reactivation and npc recurrence.genetic, environmental, and viral factors have been incriminated in the etiology of npc and epstein-barr virus (ebv) is strongly associated with the occurrence of npc. ebv is a member of the gamma herpesviruses, with a 172 kb double-stranded dna genome. the life cycle of ebv includes latency and lytic replication. eleven gene products, ebnas 1~6, lmps 1, 2a, and 2b, and small rnas eber 1 and 2, are expressed during latent infection  . upon induction by chemicals or stress, ebv is activated and enters the lytic cycle, known as reactivation. three subsets of lytic genes, immediate-early, early, and late genes, are expressed sequentially and, subsequently, viral particles are packaged and released  8] . through years of study, ebv latent infection has been considered to play an important role in npc carcinogenesis. in recent years, accumulating evidence has suggested that ebv lytic infection also contributes to the tumorigenesis of npc. sero-epidemiological surveys indicate that patients with elevated antibody titers against ebv lytic proteins, such as viral capsid antigen (vca), dnase, dna polymerase, and early antigen (ea), have a high risk of npc        . several ebv lytic products have been detected in the npc biopsies    . in addition, ebv lytic proteins, including barf1, bhrf1, brlf1, balf3, bglf4, and dnase, have been shown to have various tumorigenic functions      . in our previous study, we found that ebv reactivated by chemicals promotes cellular genome instability and tumor growth  24] . collectively, these reports suggest that inhibition of ebv reactivation might be useful for npc prevention and therapy.accordingly, for safety and convenience, we have screened several dietary compounds for anti-ebv activity. we reported that the flavonoids have activity against ebv reactivation and through the inhibition of ebv, npc tumorigenesis has been repressed    . here, we report that the phytochemical emodin has the potential ability to inhibit ebv reactivation.emodin, a common traditional chinese medicine, is an anthraquinone derivative present in the roots or rhizomes of rhubarb. emodin has various medical applications, including anti-cancer, anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation or allergy, anti-diabetes, and anti-viral or bacterial activities  . for its anti-viral effect, emodin has the ability to inhibit the sars coronavirus  , and block the replication of hbv , coxsackievirus , zika virus , and influenza a virus  . moreover, emodin has been suggested to inhibit the replication of herpesviruses    . however, the detailed mechanism is not well elucidated. in this study, based on our screening, we show that emodin inhibits ebv reactivation in epithelial cells, through the mechanism of repressing sp1 expression to inhibit the zta and rta promoter activities. moreover, through its anti-ebv activity, npc tumorigenesis could be relieved, suggesting emodin is a potential agent for therapy of ebv-associated cancer.resultsemodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methyl-anthraquinone, figure 1a ) has been shown to be cytotoxic to human cell lines. before investigating the anti-ebv effect of emodin, two ebv-positive npc cell lines, na and ha, and their parental cells tw01 and hone-1, were assessed for susceptibility to the cytotoxicity of emodin. the cells were seeded into 96-well plates 24 h prior to treatment; then, emodin was added for 48 h to determine its cytotoxic effect on the npc cell lines na and ha. emodin has significant toxicity to tw01 cells, while the derivative na cells showed little resistance to the compound (figure 1b) . a similar effect was seen on hone-1 and ha cells (figure 1b) . furthermore, to evaluate these results more precisely, half maximum of cytotoxicity concentrations 50 (cc50) were calculated and are shown in the top panels of figure 1b . the cc50 values of tw01 and the derivative na cell lines were 31 and 79 µm, while the values for hone-1 and ha were 58 and 65 µm, respectively (figure 1b) , implying that the cells harboring ebv seemed to be more resistant to emodin (tw01 vs.","Chung-Chun Wu, Mei-Shu Chen, Yu-Jhen Cheng, Ying-Chieh Ko, Su-Fang

3658,viruses Advances in MERS-CoV Vaccines and Therapeutics Based on the Receptor-Binding Domain,"abstractmiddle east respiratory syndrome (mers) coronavirus (mers-cov) is an infectious virus that was first reported in 2012. the mers-cov genome encodes four major structural proteins, among which the spike (s) protein has a key role in viral infection and pathogenesis. the receptor-binding domain (rbd) of the s protein contains a critical neutralizing domain and is an important target for development of mers vaccines and therapeutics. in this review, we describe the relevant features of the mers-cov s-protein rbd, summarize recent advances in the development of mers-cov rbd-based vaccines and therapeutic antibodies, and illustrate potential challenges and strategies to further improve their efficacy.mers-cov, particularly neutralizing antibodies that neutralize mers-cov infection, have been detected in the sera of dromedary camels from a number of countries and regions, with high positive detection rates        . in addition to camel-to-camel transmission of mers-cov, camel-to-human transmission can occur via direct or indirect contact with sick animals  . there is a high prevalence of mers-cov infection in camel workers, particularly in saudi arabia  . following infection of individuals, human-to-human transmission of mers-cov occurs frequently, and mainly contributes to community or healthcare-associated outbreaks           . infection of humans by mers-cov, which mainly occurs through the lower respiratory tract, causes severe respiratory symptoms, leading to failure of the respiratory system and/or other organs  46, 47] . on rare occasions, the human intestinal tract can be an alternative infection route  48] .anti-mers-cov antibodies, including neutralizing antibodies, are found in infected patients, some of whom have persistently presented such antibodies for up to 34 months after the disease outbreak  50] . antibody responses, and particularly neutralizing antibody responses, are crucial factors in the successful treatment of mers-cov infections in humans    . in this regard, the plasma of convalescent mers-cov-infected patients is useful for treatment of mers-cov infection clinically, but it requires a neutralizing antibody titer (e.g., 50% plaque-reduction neutralization titer: prnt 50 ) ≥1:80 to obtain effective therapeutic results    . currently, a human polyclonal igg antibody (sab-301) that is produced by transchromosomic cattle immunized with a mers-cov vaccine , as well as several vaccine candidates (  , have been tested in human clinical trials. however, as yet no vaccines or therapeutic agents have been approved for the prevention or treatment of mers, indicating the need for further development of novel and effective vaccines and therapeutics against mers-cov infection.in the following review, we will briefly describe mers-cov spike (s) protein receptor-binding domain (rbd), and summarize recent advances in the development of rbd-based mers-cov vaccines and therapeutics, as well as the potential challenges and future expectations for their successful development.mers-cov belongs to the genus betacoronavirus, as does the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)-cov  57] . mers-cov is a positive-sense, single-stranded rna virus with a genome that encodes the structural proteins s, envelope (e), membrane (m), and nucleocapsid (n), as well as non-structural proteins (nsp1-16) translated from open reading frames (orfs) 1a and 1b, and several accessory proteins, such as 3, 4a, 4b, 5, and 8b ( figure 1a ,b)     . the functions of these proteins have been elucidated. as an example, nsp1 is known to have an endonucleolytic rna-cleavage function in the promotion of infectious virus particle production in human cells  , and it also participates in efficient viral replication through interaction with viral rna, probably via a cis-acting element at the 5 -terminal coding region  . evidence indicates that nsp16 is necessary for interferon resistance and viral pathogenesis , whereas nsp15 is a nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease, the structure of which has recently been resolved, and its activity may be mediated by catalytic residues, oligomeric assembly, or rna-binding efficiency  . in addition, 4a protein recognizes and binds double-stranded (ds)rna, in which four residues of the protein might be crucial for 4a-dsrna stability  , and it also inhibits protein kinase r-mediated antiviral stress responses  . 4a mediated-inhibition of stress-granule formation may facilitate viral translation, resulting in efficient mers-cov replication . the mers-cov 4b protein interferes with the nf-κb-dependent innate immune response during infection . viruses 2019, 11, 60 3

been developed based on viral rbd, including nanoparticles, virus-like particles (vlps), and recombinant proteins, and their protective efficacy has been evaluated in animal models, including mice with adenovirus 5 (ad5)-directed expression of human dpp4 (ad5/hdpp4), hdpp4-transgenic (hdpp4-tg) mice, and non-human primates (nhps)        . features of these rbd-based vaccines, in terms of functionality, antigenicity, immunogenicity, and protective ability, are shown in table 1 .","Yusen Zhou, Yang Yang, Jingwei Huang, Shibo Jiang, Lanying Du"
831,The timing of one-shot interventions for epidemic control,"abstractthe apparent early success in china's large-scale intervention to control the covid-19 epidemic has led to interest in whether other countries can replicate it as well as concerns about a resurgence of the epidemic if or when china relaxes the interventions. in this paper we look at the impact of a single short-term intervention on an epidemic. we see that if an intervention cannot be sustained long-term, it has the greatest impact if it is imposed once infection levels have become large enough that there is an appreciable number of infections present. for minimising the total number infected it should start close to the peak so that there is no rebound once the intervention is stopped, while to minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, allowing two peaks of comparable size rather than one very large peak. in populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each sub-population separately.we do not attempt to clearly determine what makes an intervention sustainable or not. we believe that is a policy question. if an intervention is sustainable, it should be kept in place. our intent is to offer insight into how best to time an intervention whose impact on society is too great to maintain.","Francesco Di Lauro, István Z Kiss, Joel C Miller"

11692,Establishment a real-time reverse transcription PCR based on host biomarkers for the detection of the subclinical cases of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis,"abstractbovine paratuberculosis (ptb) is a chronic enteric inflammatory disease of ruminants caused by mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (map) that causes large economic losses in the dairy industry. spread of ptb is mainly provoked by a long subclinical stage during which map is shed into the environment with feces; accordingly, detection of subclinical animals is very important to its control. however, current diagnostic methods are not suitable for detection of subclinical animals. therefore, the current study was conducted to develop a diagnostic method for analysis of the expression of genes of prognostic potential biomarker candidates in the whole blood of cattle naturally infected with map. real-time pcr with nine potential biomarker candidates was developed for the diagnosis of map subclinical infection. animals were divided into four groups based on fecal map pcr and serum elisa. eight genes (timp1, hp, serpine1, tfrc, mmp9, defb1, defb10, and s100a8) were up-regulated in map-infected cattle (p <0.05). moreover, roc analysis revealed that eight genes (timp1, hp, serpine1, tfrc, mmp9, defb1, defb10, and s100a8) showed fair diagnostic performance (auc!0.8). four biomarkers (timp1, s100a8, defb1, and defb10) showed the highest diagnostic accuracy in the pcr positive and elisa negative group (pn group) and three biomarkers (tfrc, hp, and serpine1) showed the highest diagnostic accuracy in the pcr negative and elisa positive group (np group). moreover, three biomarkers (s100a8, hp, and defb10) were considered the most reliable for the pcr positive and elisa positive group (pp group). taken together, our data suggest that real-time pcr based on eight biomarkers (timp1, hp, serpine1, tfrc, mmp9, defb1, defb10, and s100a8) might be useful for diagnosis of jd, including subclinical stage cases.","Hyun-Eui Park, Hong-Tae Park, Young Hoon Jung, Han Sang Yoo"
11845,"Multiple functions of DDX3 RNA helicase in gene regulation, tumorigenesis, and viral infection","abstractthe dead-box rna helicase ddx3 is a multifunctional protein involved in all aspects of rna metabolism, including transcription, splicing, mrna nuclear export, translation, rna decay and ribosome biogenesis. in addition, ddx3 is also implicated in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, wnt-β-catenin signaling, tumorigenesis, and viral infection. notably, recent studies suggest that ddx3 is a component of anti-viral innate immune signaling pathways. indeed, ddx3 contributes to enhance the induction of anti-viral mediators, interferon (ifn) regulatory factor 3 and type i ifn. however, ddx3 seems to be an important target for several viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1), hepatitis c virus (hcv), hepatitis b virus (hbv), and poxvirus. ddx3 interacts with hiv-1 rev or hcv core protein and modulates its function. at least, ddx3 is required for both hiv-1 and hcv replication. therefore, ddx3 could be a novel therapeutic target for the development of drug against hiv-1 and hcv.",Yasuo Ariumi

6118,STAT3 roles in viral infection: antiviral or proviral?,"abstractsignal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) is a transcription factor which can be activated by cytokines, growth factor receptors, and nonreceptor-like tyrosine kinase. an activated stat3 translocates into the nucleus and combines with dna to regulate the expression of target genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and metastasis. recent studies have shown that stat3 plays important roles in viral infection and pathogenesis. stat3 exhibits a proviral function in several viral infections, including those of hbv, hcv, hsv-1, varicella zoster virus, human cmv and measles virus. however, in some circumstances, stat3 has an antiviral function in other viral infections, such as enterovirus 71, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and human metapneumovirus. this review summarizes the roles of stat3 in viral infection and pathogenesis, and briefly discusses the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes.signal transducer and activator of transcription factors (stats) are a family of transcription factors that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, inflammation and oncogenesis    . seven stat proteins (stat1-4, stat5a, stat5b and stat6) have been discovered in mammals  . when activated by cytokines and growth factors, stats become phosphorylated on specific tyrosine residues by janus kinases (jaks) and form homodimers or heterodimers and then translocate to the nucleus where they regulate the transcription of target genes  . each stat protein contains six conservative domains; however, upon activated by the specific stimulators, the stats are phosphorylated in a stat-specific manner at distinct residues in the c-terminal domain by different jak members. therefore, stats play different roles in the multiple biological processes  5] . specifically, stat3 plays a central role in the development, immunity and carcinogenesis, since it critically regulates the transcription of multiple key genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, immune responses, angiogenesis and metastasis  .stat3 is first identified as a dna-binding factor that selectively attaches to the il-6-responsive elements in the promoter region of the il-6-stimulated hepatocytes under the acute phase  . as a central axis signal transduction molecule, stat3 plays an important regulatory role in the process of cellular immune responses, antagonizes the release of cytokines, such as il-12 and ifn-γ, from th1 cell, and regulates the development and differentiation of t helper cells, such as t reg , th 1 and th 17 -9]. furthermore, it can regulate cell apoptosis through the fas, bcl-xl, and bcl-2 genes  . recently, the role of stat3 in viral infection has been attracting research interest. several studies showed that stat3 affects many kinds of viral infections and pathogeneses, including those of hbv, hcv, varicella zoster virus (vzv), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov)     . the present review summarizes the roles of stat3 in these viral infections and pathogeneses, and simply discusses the molecular mechanisms by which stat3 functions, specifically in the virus life cycles and related disease development.","Zhangmei Chang, Yan Wang, Xin Zhou, Jian-Er Long"
4336,Citation: Coxsackievirus A6 Induces Cell Cycle Arrest in G0/G1 Phase for Viral Production,"abstractrecent epidemiological data indicate that outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease (hfmd), which can be categorized according to its clinical symptoms as typical or atypical, have markedly increased worldwide. a primary causative agent for typical hfmd outbreaks, enterovirus 71 (ev71), has been shown to manipulate the cell cycle in s phase for own replication; however, it is not clear whether coxsackievirus (cva6), the main agent for atypical hfmd, also regulates the host cell cycle. in this study, we demonstrate for the first time that cva6 infection arrests the host cell cycle in g0/g1-phase. furthermore, synchronization in g0/g1 phase, but not s phase or g2/m phase, promotes viral production. to investigate the mechanism of cell cycle arrest induced by cva6 infection, we analyzed cell cycle progression after cell cycle synchronization at g0/g1 or g2/m. our results demonstrate that cva6 infection promotes g0/g1 phase entry from g2/m phase, and inhibits g0/g1 exit into s phase. in line with its role to arrest cells in g0/g1 phase, the expression of cyclind1, cdk4, cycline1, cdk2, cyclinb1, cdk1, p53, p21, and p16 is regulated by cva6. finally, the non-structural proteins of cva6, rna-dependent rna polymerase 3d and protease 3c , are demonstrated to be responsible for the g0/g1-phase arrest. these findings suggest that cva6 infection arrested cell cycle in g0/g1-phase via non-structural proteins 3d and 3c, which may provide favorable environments for virus production.","Weifeng Shi, Jinghua Yu, Wang Z Wang, Y , Wang S , Meng X , Song F , Huo W , Zhang S , Chang J Li, J , Zheng B Liu, Y Zhang, Zhang W , Yu J , Zengyan Wang, Yue Wang, † , Shaohua Wang, Xiangling Meng, Fengmei Song, Wenbo Huo, Shuxia Zhang, Junliang Chang, Jingliang Li, Baisong Zheng, Yanqiu Liu, Yahong Zhang, Wenyan Zhang"

9866,Inhibition of a Putative Dihydropyrimidinase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 by Flavonoids and Substrates of Cyclic Amidohydrolases,"abstractdihydropyrimidinase is a member of the cyclic amidohydrolase family, which also includes allantoinase, dihydroorotase, hydantoinase, and imidase. these metalloenzymes possess very similar active sites and may use a similar mechanism for catalysis. however, whether the substrates and inhibitors of other cyclic amidohydrolases can inhibit dihydropyrimidinase remains unclear. this study investigated the inhibition of dihydropyrimidinase by flavonoids and substrates of other cyclic amidohydrolases. allantoin, dihydroorotate, 5hydantoin acetic acid, acetohydroxamate, orotic acid, and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole could slightly inhibit dihydropyrimidinase, and the ic 50 values of these compounds were within the millimolar range. the inhibition of dihydropyrimidinase by flavonoids, such as myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, galangin, dihydromyricetin, and myricitrin, was also investigated. some of these compounds are known as inhibitors of allantoinase and dihydroorotase. although the inhibitory effects of these flavonoids on dihydropyrimidinase were substrate-dependent, dihydromyricetin significantly inhibited dihydropyrimidinase with ic 50 values of 48 and 40 μm for the substrates dihydrouracil and 5-propyl-hydantoin, respectively. the results from the lineweaver−burk plot indicated that dihydromyricetin was a competitive inhibitor. results from fluorescence quenching analysis indicated that dihydromyricetin could form a stable complex with dihydropyrimidinase with the k d value of 22.6 μm. a structural study using patchdock showed that dihydromyricetin was docked in the active site pocket of dihydropyrimidinase, which was consistent with the findings from kinetic and fluorescence studies. this study was the first to demonstrate that naturally occurring product dihydromyricetin inhibited dihydropyrimidinase, even more than the substrate analogs (>3 orders of magnitude). these flavonols, particularly myricetin, may serve as drug leads and dirty drugs (for multiple targets) for designing compounds that target several cyclic amidohydrolases. in the second step of the pyrimidine degradation pathway, respectively  2] . dihydropyrimidinase, a component in the chain of pyrimidine catabolism, is also capable of detoxifying xenobiotics with an imide functional group that ranges from linear imides to heterocyclic imides  4, 5] and organic cyclic carbonates  . these different imide-hydrolyzing enzymes from microorganisms are normally known as hydantoinase because of their role as biocatalysts in the synthesis of d-and l-amino acids for the industrial production of the precursors of antibiotics  8] . although dihydropyrimidinase and hydantoinase generally have a similar active site, their overall sequence identity and substrate specificity differ  . thus, some bacterial hydantoinases are still named and identified as dihydropyrimidinase because of the catalytic activity toward the natural substrates dihydrouracil and dihydrothymine.based on their functional and structural similarities, dihydropyrimidinase, hydantoinase, imidase, allantoinase, and dihydroorotase belong to the cyclic amidohydrolase family  . even if these enzymes have similar functions, they have relatively low amino acid sequence identity. these metal-dependent enzymes catalyze the ring-opening hydrolysis of the cyclic amide bond of each substrate in either five-or six-membered rings in the metabolism of purines, pyrimidines, and many xenobiotics ( fig 1a)  11, 12, 13] . almost all the active sites of dihydropyrimidinase, hydantoinase, allantoinase, and dihydroorotase contain four histidines, one aspartate, and one post-carboxylated lysine residue, which are required for metal binding and catalytic activity. the presence of a post-carboxylated lysine in hydantoinase is also required in binuclear metal center self-assembly  , and it increases the nucleophilicity of the hydroxide for catalysis  . previous studies indicated that cyclic amidohydrolases should use a nearly identical mechanism for catalysis. however, the substrate selectivity and specificity of dihydropyrimidinase, hydantoinase, allantoinase, and dihydroorotase highly differ. for example, dihydroorotase does not hydrolyze dihydropyrimidine, hydantoin, and allantoin  . fig 1. substrate specificity of dihydropyrimidinase.

3442,"Avian Group D Rotaviruses: Structure, Epidemiology, Diagnosis, and Perspectives on Future Research Challenges","abstractin 1981, a new virus (virus 132) was described for the first time with morphological and biochemical similarities to rotaviruses (rvs), but without antigenic similarity to any of the previously known rotavirus groups. subsequently, it was re-designated as d/132, and formed a new serogroup among rotaviruses, the group d rotavirus (rvd). since their identification, rvs are the leading cause of enteritis and diarrhea in humans and various animal species, and are also associated with abridged growth, particularly in avian species. recently, rvd has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of runting and stunting syndrome (rss), alongside other viruses such as reovirus, astrovirus, coronavirus, and others, all of which cause colossal economic losses to the poultry industry. rvd has been reported from several countries worldwide, and to date, only one complete genome sequence for rvd is available. neither an immunodiagnostic nor a vaccine is available for the detection and prevention of rvd infection. despite our growing understanding about this particular group, questions remain regarding its exact prevalence and pathogenecity, and the disease-associated annual losses for the poultry industry. here, we describe the current knowledge about the identification, epidemiology, diagnosis, and prevention of rvd in poultry.","Pallavi Deol, Jobin Jose Kattoor, Shubhankar Id,  Sircar, Souvik Ghosh, Krisztián Bányai, Kuldeep Dhama, I D , Yashpal Singh, Malik "
10873,"molecules Synthetic Compounds with 2-Amino-1,3,4-Thiadiazole Moiety Against Viral Infections","abstractviral infections have resulted in millions of victims in human history. although great efforts have been made to find effective medication, there are still no drugs that truly cure viral infections. there are currently approximately 90 drugs approved for the treatment of human viral infections. as resistance toward available antiviral drugs has become a global threat to health, there is an intrinsic need to identify new scaffolds that are useful in discovering innovative, less toxic and highly active antiviral agents. 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives have been extensively studied due to their pharmacological profile, physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. this review provides an overview of the various synthetic compounds containing the 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole moiety that has been evaluated for antiviral activity against several viral strains and could be considered possible prototypes for the development of new antiviral drugs.molecules 2020, 25, 942 2 of 22 due to the ability of viruses to undergo rapid mutations, the mechanisms involved in developing resistance to antiviral drugs are activated in most cases  3] . as resistance toward antiviral drugs is becoming a global health threat, there is an intrinsic need to identify new scaffolds that are useful in discovering innovative, less toxic and highly active antiviral agents .nitrogen-containing heterocycles are widely distributed in nature and are essential in vegetal and animal metabolism. they are found in nucleic acids, vitamins, antibiotics, alkaloids, etc.        . in addition, nitrogen-containing heterocycles are important targets for medicinal chemistry, as they are found in more than half of the commercially available drugs and can also act as versatile intermediates in the synthesis of complex products that exhibit outstanding biological activities  . most of the nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds exhibit better biological activity than non-nitrogen compounds  16, 17] . currently, there are approximately 90 drugs approved for use in the treatment of nine human viral infections caused by human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), hepatitis b virus (hbv), hepatitis c virus (hcv), herpes simplex virus (hsv), influenza virus, human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), varicella-zoster virus (vzv), respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) and human papillomavirus  . most of these drugs (e.g., acyclovir, cidofovir, idoxuridine, nevirapine, pleconaril, ribavirin, etc.) are nitrogen heterocycle molecules  19] .five-membered aromatic systems with three heteroatoms at symmetrical positions, such as the 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring, have been extensively studied due to their pharmacological profile and physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives are known as compounds having significant and diverse biological activities such as antibacterial, antifungal, antitubercular , analgesic and anti-inflammatory  22] , antidepressant and anxiolytic , kinesin inhibitors , etc. the 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring is also found in several medicines such as acetazolamide, methazolamide, cefazolin, cefazedone, sulfamethizole or megazol     . the 1,3,4-thiadiazole nucleus provides the compounds with high lipophilicity and the ability to form mesoionic systems associated with discrete regions of positive and negative charges. these distinct features allow mesoionic compounds to efficiently cross cellular membranes, leading to good oral absorption, bioavailability and strong unique interactions with biological molecules (e.g., dna, proteins, etc.) thus increasing the potential of 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives to exhibit biological activities     . the thiadiazole ring is a bioisostere of the pyrimidine and pyridazine rings. the pyrimidine nucleus is commonly found in naturally occurring compounds of biochemical importance, as well as in drugs (e.g., pyrimidine nucleosides and nucleotides, nucleic acids, antiviral drugs), while the pyridazine nucleus is a component of some pharmacologically active compounds     . the thiadiazole ring also acts as a bioisostere of the thiazole ring, and therefore thiadiazole derivatives can act in the same way as third-and fourth-generation antibacterial cephalosporins. this is an additional feature that highlights the high potential of this ring system in medicinal chemistry  28] . many researchers suppose there is a connection between the biological potential of 1,3,4-thiadiazoles and the strongly aromatic character of the 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring, as well as the presence of the toxophoric =n-c-slinkage group. furthermore, the high in vivo stability and low toxicity for higher organisms are also attributed to the 1,3,4-thiadiazole ring  33, 34] . in addition, the amine derivatives of 1,3,4-thiadiazole are also studied. 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole moiety and its derivatives are known for their antitumor, antitrypanosomal and uricogenic properties  25, 27,     . 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives are currently being synthesized in many laboratories, and in previous papers, we described several 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazoles that exhibit antibacterial, antifungal, antitubercular        , and antiparasitic activities  38] . the purpose of this paper is to present some small molecules possessing the 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole moiety that have shown antiviral activity.molecules 2020, 25, 942 3 of 22",Georgeta Serban

10049,Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) for the Diagnosis of Zika Virus: A Review,"abstractthe recent outbreak of zika virus (zikv) in the americas and its devastating developmental and neurological manifestations has prompted the development of field-based diagnostics that are rapid, reliable, handheld, specific, sensitive, and inexpensive. the gold standard molecular method for lab-based diagnosis of zikv, from either patient samples or insect vectors, is reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-qpcr). the method, however, is costly and requires lab-based equipment and expertise, which severely limits its use as a point-of-care (poc) tool in resource-poor settings. moreover, given the lack of antivirals or approved vaccines for zikv infection, a poc diagnostic test is urgently needed for the early detection of new outbreaks and to adequately manage patients. loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) is a compelling alternative to rt-qpcr for zikv and other arboviruses. this low-cost molecular system can be freeze-dried for distribution and exhibits high specificity, sensitivity, and efficiency. a growing body of evidence suggests that lamp assays can provide greater accessibility to much-needed diagnostics for zikv infections, especially in developing countries where the zikv is now endemic. this review summarizes the different lamp methods that have been developed for the virus and summarizes their features, advantages, and limitations.viruses 2020, 12, 19 2 of 20 raising concerns about the neurological tropism of the virus  . in may 2015, the first case of zikv infection was reported in brazil  and the virus rapidly spread throughout the country and much of latin america, causing the largest recorded epidemic of the virus to date  . the brazilian epidemic raised great international concern because of severe birth defects, including microcephaly, in neonates born to mothers infected by zikv during pregnancy  15, 16] .zikv is transmitted mainly through the bite of infected mosquitoes from the genus aedes, although other vectors may also be involved in the transmission      . additionally, other routes of zikv transmission have been identified, including blood transfusions, transplacental, perinatal, and sexual intercourse    . zikv infection usually causes a self-limiting and a mild illness, where the majority of cases are asymptomatic and, when present, symptoms include fever, headache, rash, conjunctivitis, and arthralgia  . in regions where there is a circulation of other arboviruses, such as denv and chikungunya (chikv), the clinical diagnosis of zikv infection becomes extremely difficult because of common symptoms. therefore, laboratory-based molecular diagnosis is of fundamental importance to correctly identify the etiologic agent  26] .given the lack of approved vaccines and antivirals against zikv, a rapid and reliable point-of-care (poc) diagnostic test for detection of zikv is urgently required for control and prevention measures and to increase the diagnostic capacity of zikv-affected, mainly in low-resource areas  28] . zikv infection is diagnosed in the laboratory by nucleic acid amplification tests or serological methods, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisa), plaque reduction neutralization tests (prnt), and lateral flow assays (rapid tests)  7,     . currently, rt-qpcr is considered the gold standard method to detect zikv from patient and mosquito samples  7, 29] . although rt-qpcr provides high-quality results, the test requires extensive sample preparation, rna extraction, expensive equipment, and technical expertise to run and interpret the amplification of the viral rna. moreover, available serological methods are prone to produce false-positive results due to cross-reaction with other flaviviruses in circulation, such as denv, and are therefore of limited value  7, 33] .loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) is a powerful alternative poc assay for the virus as it allows rapid, robust, and simple amplification of nucleic acid targets at a single and fixed temperature  . the assay has many advantages over rt-qpcr, including rapidity, low cost, high sensitivity, and high specificity. lamp results can also be easily read with the naked eye through color-based reporters that can be added to the reaction mixture  . importantly, the simple, single-temperature incubation allows lamp reactions to be performed without expensive equipment, directly in the field  . since the 2015 emergence of the zikv in brazil, many lamp assays have been developed for diagnosis by research groups across the world           . these diagnostic platforms based on lamp have proven to be specific, sensitive and inexpensive poc tools that can be applied even in resource-limited regions of the world. here we review the development and application of lamp methods for the diagnosis of zikv and explore the next steps to bring this assay into mainstream use.","Severino Jefferson, Ribeiro Da Silva, Keith Pardee, Lindomar Pena"
9323,OPEN ACCESS,"abstractseveral clinical scoring systems for diagnosis of bovine respiratory disease (brd) in calves have been proposed. however, such systems were based on subjective judgment, rather than statistical methods, to weight scores. data from a pair-matched case-control study on a california calf raising facility was used to develop three novel scoring systems to diagnose brd in preweaned dairy calves. disease status was assigned using both clinical signs and diagnostic test results for brd-associated pathogens. regression coefficients were used to weight score values. the systems presented use nasal and ocular discharge, rectal temperature, ear and head carriage, coughing, and respiratory quality as predictors. the systems developed in this research utilize fewer severity categories of clinical signs, require less calf handling, and had excellent agreement (kappa > 0.8) when compared to an earlier scoring system. the first scoring system dichotomized all clinical predictors but required inducing a cough. the second scoring system removed induced cough as a clinical abnormality but required distinguishing between three levels of nasal discharge severity. the third system removed induced cough and forced a dichotomized variable for nasal discharge. the first system presented in this study used the following predictors and assigned values: coughing (induced or spontaneous coughing, 2 points), nasal discharge (any discharge, 3 points), ocular discharge (any discharge, 2 points), ear and head carriage (ear droop or head tilt, 5 points), fever (≥39.2 • c or 102.5 • f, 2 points), and respiratory quality (abnormal respiration, 2 points). calves were categorized ""brd positive"" if their total score was ≥4. this system correctly classified 95.4% cases and 88.6% controls. the second presented system categorized the predictors and assigned weights as follows: coughing (spontaneous only, 2 points), mild nasal discharge (unilateral, serous, or watery discharge, 3 points), moderate to severe nasal discharge (bilateral, cloudy, mucoid, mucopurlent, or copious discharge, 5 points), ocular discharge (any discharge, 1 point), ear and head carriage (ear droop or head tilt, 5 points), fever (≥39.2 • c, 2 points), and respiratory quality (abnormal how to cite this article love et al.

5569,"Differential Seroprevalence of Human Bocavirus Species 1-4 in Beijing, China","abstractbackground: four species of human bocaviruses (hbov1-4) have been identified based on phylogenetic analysis since its first report in 2005. hbov1 has been associated with respiratory disease, whereas hbov2-4 are mainly detected in enteric infections. although the prevalence of hbovs in humans has been studied in some regions, it has not been well addressed globally.methodology/principal findings: cross-reactivity of anti-vp2 antibodies was detected between hbov1, 2, 3, and 4 in mouse and human serum. the prevalence of specific anti-vp2 igg antibodies against hbov1-4 was determined in different age groups of healthy individuals aged 0-70 years old in beijing, china, using a competition elisa assay based on virus-like particles of hbov1-4. the seroprevalence of hbov1-4 was 50%, 36.9%, 28.7%, and 0.8%, respectively, in children aged 0-14 years (n = 244); whereas the seroprevalence of hbov1-4 was 66.9%, 49.3%, 38.7% and 1.4%, respectively, in healthy adults ($15 years old; n = 142). the seropositive rate of hbov1 was higher than that of hbov2, hbov3, and hbov4 in individuals older than 0.5 years. furthermore, igg seroconversion of hbov1 (10/31, 32.3%), hbov2 (8/31, 25.8%), and hbov3 (2/31, 6.5%) was found in paired sera collected from children with respiratory tract infections who were positive for hbov1 according to pcr analysis.conclusions/significance: our data indicate that hbov1 is more prevalent than hbov2, hbov3, and hbov4 in the population we sampled in beijing, china, suggesting that hbov species may play differential roles in disease.","Li Guo, Yaying Wang, Hongli Zhou, Chao Wu, Jingdong Song, Jianguo Li, Glá Ucia Paranhos-Baccalà, Guy Vernet, Jianwei Wang, Tao Hung"
9472,Effects of oxidative and thermal stresses on stress granule formation in human induced pluripotent stem cells,"abstractstress granules (sgs) are dynamic ribonucleoprotein aggregates, which have been observed in cells subjected to environmental stresses, such as oxidative stress and heat shock (hs). although pluripotent stem cells (pscs) are highly sensitive to oxidative stress, the role of sgs in regulating psc self-renewal and differentiation has not been fully elucidated. here we found that sodium arsenite (sa) and hs, but not hydrogen peroxide (h 2 o 2 ), induce sg formation in human induced (hi) pscs. particularly, we found that these granules contain the well-known sg proteins (g3bp, tiar, eif4e, eif4a, eif3b, eif4g, and pabp), were found in juxtaposition to processing bodies (pbs), and were disassembled after the removal of the stress. moreover, we showed that sa and hs, but not h 2 o 2 , promote eif2α phosphorylation in hipscs forming sgs. analysis of pluripotent protein expression showed that hs significantly reduced all tested markers (oct4, sox2, nanog, klf4, l1td1, and lin28a), while sa selectively reduced the expression levels of nanog and l1td1. finally, in addition to lin28a and l1td1, we identified dppa5 (pluripotent protein marker) as a novel component of sgs. collectively, these results provide new insights into the molecular cues of hipscs responses to environmental insults.","Freshteh Palangi, Samson M Samuel, I Richard Thompson, Chris R Triggle, Mohamed M Emara"
7287,A Review and Update on Waterborne Viral Diseases Associated with Swimming Pools,"abstractinfectious agents, including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and molds, may threaten the health of swimming pool bathers. viruses are a major cause of recreationally-associated waterborne diseases linked to pools, lakes, ponds, thermal pools/spas, rivers, and hot springs. they can make their way into waters through the accidental release of fecal matter, body fluids (saliva, mucus), or skin flakes by symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers. we present an updated overview of epidemiological data on viral outbreaks, a project motivated, among other things, by the availability of improved viral detection methodologies. special attention is paid to outbreak investigations (source of the outbreak, pathways of transmission, chlorination/disinfection). epidemiological studies on incidents of viral contamination of swimming pools under non-epidemic conditions are also reviewed.","Lucia Bonadonna, Giuseppina La Rosa"
12394,Broadly resistant HIV-1 against CD4-binding site neutralizing antibodies,"abstractrecently identified broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnabs) show great potential for clinical interventions against hiv-1 infection. however, resistant strains may impose substantial challenges. here, we report on the identification and characterization of a panel of hiv-1 strains with broad and potent resistance against a large number of bnabs, particularly those targeting the cd4-binding site (cd4bs). site-directed mutagenesis revealed that several key epitope mutations facilitate resistance and are located in the inner domain, loop d, and β23/loop v5/β24 of hiv-1 gp120. the resistance is largely correlated with binding affinity of antibodies to the envelope trimers expressed on the cell surface. our results therefore demonstrate the existence of broadly resistant hiv-1 strains against cd4bs neutralizing antibodies. treatment strategies based on the cd4bs bnabs must overcome such resistance to achieve optimal clinical outcomes.recently identified broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnabs) show great potential for clinical interventions against hiv-1 infection. among the bnabs isolated to date, those targeting the cd4bs are the most abundant and thoroughly studied as they disrupt the crucial step of viral interaction with the cellular receptor molecule cd4. despite the superior potency and breadth of these cd4bs bnabs, each fails to neutralize a small but significant portion of pseudotyped virus panels. here, we report on the identification and characterization of a panel of hiv-1 strains with broad and potent resistance against a large number of bnabs, particularly those targeting the cd4bs. resistance is largely attributed to mutated residues within the epitopes or steric hindrance imposed by the bulky side-chain or glycan shield of the mutated residues, and is largely correlated with reduced binding avidity of the antibody to the quaternary trimeric envelope protein expressed on the plos pathogens |  of the transfected cells. treatment strategies based on the cd4bs bnabs therefore must overcome such resistance to achieve optimal clinical outcomes.recent scientific advances have identified a growing number of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnabs) against human immunodeficiency virus type i (hiv-1), providing promising candidates for hiv-1 prevention and treatment      . compared with bnabs isolated in earlier studies, these bnabs demonstrated broader and more potent activity against global hiv-1 panels and displayed impressive safety and efficacy profiles for therapeutic applications in a number of animal models and human clinical trials        . these results also offer the opportunity to tailor these antibodies and maximize their prevention and treatment potential. broadly speaking, these bnabs recognize six major ""vulnerable sites"" on the hiv-1 envelope glycoprotein gp160 (gp120 and gp41), which are (1) the cd4-binding site (cd4bs), (2) the v1v2 apex, (3) the v3 glycan, (4) the fusion peptide (fp), (5) subunit interface and (6) membrane proximal external region (mper) of gp41-5]. these bnabs neutralize hiv-1 by blocking viral entry into the target cells, although additional effector functions are likely at play, particularly in the context of in vivo infection and clinical application 12-16].among the bnabs isolated to date, those targeting the cd4bs are the most abundant and thoroughly studied as they disrupt the first and crucial step of viral interaction with the cellular receptor cd4  4, 17, 18] . in this step, the trimeric envelope glycoprotein, composed of gp120 and gp41, binds with the target cell through the receptor cd4, with either ccr5 or cxcr4 as co-receptor    . this triggers a cascade of conformational changes that fuses the viral envelope with the target membrane and releases the viral genome into the cell  23] .more than two dozen cd4bs bnabs have been isolated to date. this number is likely to grow with the advent of more specific and high-throughput techniques for isolating antibodies.for instance, the prototype vrc01 and its close relative vrc03, which effectively neutralize a panel of diverse pseudotyped viruses,were isolated from a clade-b infected individual    . the more recently isolated cd4bs bnabs, such as 3bnc117, n6, n49p7, 3bnc60, vrc-pg04, vrc-pg20, nih45-46, vrc-ch31, 12a12, ch103, 8anc131, vrc13, and vrc16, have shown similar or even enhanced potency and breadth compared with vrc01 -5, 27, 28].the cd4bs bnabs are classified into two groups based on their mode of recognition and heavy chain characteristics, such as the vrc01 class(3bnc117, n6, n49p7, 3bnc60, vrc-pg04, vrc-pg20, nih45-46, vrc-ch31 and 12a12) and non-vrc01 classes (ch103, 8anc131, vrc13 and vrc16)  18] . structurally, these bnabs recognize residues within the inner domain, the loop d, the cd4 binding loop, and the β23/loop v5/β24 region  18,    .the v1v2 and v3 loop also impact recognition,particularly in the context of the quaternary trimeric envelope protein      .the primary mechanism of neutralization mimics and competes with the cd4 receptorto bind hiv-1 gp120, thereby preventing bound trimers from transitioning to the subsequent steps required for membrane fusion, although evidence indicates that there are differences in the fine details of this process  18, 35, 36] .despite the superior potency and breadth of these cd4bs bnabs, each fails to neutralize a small but significant portion of pseudotyped virus panels  25, 27, 28, 37, 38].for instance, vrc01 is unable to neutralize about 10% of tested viruses  , and resistant strains have been isolated from patients infected with subtype b, subtype c, crf07_bc, and crf08_bc     . furthermore, reports show thatvrc01-, 3bnc117-and n6-resistant strains have emerged in both animal models and human clinical trials  15,      , indicating that resistant virus broadly resistant hiv-1

3047,A Universal Protein Tag for Delivery of SiRNA-Aptamer Chimeras,"abstractsirna-aptamer chimeras have emerged as one of the most promising approaches for targeted delivery of sirna due to the modularity of their diblock rna structure, relatively lower cost over other targeted delivery approaches, and, most importantly, the outstanding potential for clinical translation. however, additional challenges must be addressed for efficient rna interference (rnai), in particular, endosomal escape. currently, vast majority of sirna delivery vehicles are based on cationic materials, which form complexes with negatively charged sirna. unfortunately, these approaches complicate the formulations again by forming large complexes with heterogeneous sizes, unfavorable surface charges, colloidal instability, and poor targeting ligand orientation. here, we report the development of a small and simple protein tag that complements the therapeutic and targeting functionalities of chimera with two functional domains: a dsrna binding domain (dsrbd) for sirna docking and a ph-dependent polyhistidine to disrupt endosomal membrane. the protein selectively tags along the sirna block of individual chimera, rendering the overall size of the complex small, desirable for deep tissue penetration, and the aptamer block accessible for target recognition. more interestingly, we found that extending the c-terminal polyhistidine segment in the protein tag to 18 amino acids completely abolishes the rna binding function of dsrbd. s irna is of considerable current interest because it can elicit potent, target-specific knockdown of virtually any mrna, creating new opportunities for personalized medicine and for addressing a broad range of traditionally undruggable disease targets using small molecules 1-3 . similar to other antisense approaches, however, cell-specific delivery of sirna technology in vivo still represents a major technical hurdle 4 . to guide sirna to diseased cells, targeting ligands such as small molecules, lipids, peptides, and proteins have been identified and linked directly to sirna or on the surface of sirna nanocarriers 5-10 . considering the complex physical and chemical structures of various formulations, the sirna-targeting ligand-delivery vehicle complexes face difficulty in large-scale production and regulatory approval for clinical uses.recently, sirna-aptamer chimera, employing only rna molecules, has emerged as a highly promising approach for cell type-specific rnai, owing to its low immunogenicity, ease of chemical synthesis and modification, small size, and the targeting specificity of aptamers. rna-based aptamers are identified through in vitro enrichment known as selex (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) 11-14 . similar to antibodies, they are capable of binding to various molecular targets including small molecules, proteins, and cells, while offering key advantages as they can be completely identified and produced with desired chemical modifications in vitro through automated processes. for aptamer-guided sirna delivery, exciting works by mcnamara, dassie, and coworkers show that chimeras composed of aptamer targeting prostate specific membrane antigen (psma) and sirna targeting anti-apoptotic genes (plk1) have been made and optimized 15,16 . the aptamer block recognizes psma on prostate tumor cell surface and leads to chimera cell internalization, whereas the sirna block enzymatically cleaved from the chimera promotes cell death. significantly reduced tumor mass was observed in mouse xenograft models of prostate tumor after administration of the chimera, though the exact mechanism of chimera endosomal escape remains unclear 17 . this limitation helps explain why high concentrations of chimera were required in these pioneer studies to treat prostate tumors 15, 16 .an obvious solution to this problem is to combine chimeras with nanocarriers with endosome rupturing capabilities. common delivery vehicles include lipids, polymers, and inorganic nanoparticles such as gold, silica, magnetic, and semiconductor nanoparticles      . for sirna immobilization, condensation, stabilization against enzymatic degradation, and endosomal escape, virtually all these nanocarriers are positively charged, and so are their sirna complexes. unfortunately, the electrostatically induced nanocarrier-chimera condensation almost completely defies the purpose of simple formulation for sirna clinical translation because the final nanoparticles become complex again, with mixed sizes, surface properties, aptamer conformations and orientations, and batchto-batch variations. for example, the size difference between the original intact chimeras (nanometers) with the open subject areas: drug delivery nanoparticles","Hong Yan Liu, Xiaohu Gao"

11816,Analysis of Chemokines and Receptors Expression Profile in the Myelin Mutant Taiep Rat,"abstracttaiep rat has a failure in myelination and remyelination processes leading to a state of hypomyelination throughout its life. chemokines, which are known to play a role in inflammation, are also involved in the remyelination process. we aimed to demonstrate that remyelination-stimulating factors are altered in the brainstem of 1-and 6-month-old taiep rats. we used a rat rt 2 profiler pcr array to assess mrna expression of 84 genes coding for cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors. we also evaluated protein levels of ccl2, ccr1, ccr2, ccl5, ccr5, ccr8, cxcl1, cxcr2, cxcr4, fgf2, and vegfa by elisa. sprague-dawley rats were used as a control. pcr array procedure showed that proinflammatory cytokines were not upregulated in the taiep rat. in contrast, some mrna levels of beta and alpha chemokines were upregulated in 1-month-old rats, but cxcr4 was downregulated at their 6 months of age. elisa results showed that cxcl1, ccl2, ccr2, ccr5, ccr8, and cxcr4 protein levels were decreased in brainstem at the age of 6 months. these results suggest the presence of a chronic neuroinflammation process with deficiency of remyelination-stimulating factors (cxcl1, cxcr2, and cxcr4), which might account for the demyelination in the taiep rat.","Guadalupe Soto-Rodriguez, Juan-Antonio Gonzalez-Barrios, Daniel Martinez-Fong, Victor-Manuel Blanco-Alvarez, Jose R Eguibar, Araceli Ugarte, Francisco Martinez-Perez, Eduardo Brambila, Lourdes Millán-Perez,  Peña, Nidia-Gary Pazos-Salazar, Maricela Torres-Soto, Guadalupe Garcia-Robles, Constantino Tomas-Sanchez, Bertha Alicia Leon-Chavez"
6129,Prevalence and Correlation of Infectious Agents in Hospitalized Children with Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in Central China,"abstractacute respiratory tract infections (artis) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in children under the age of 5 years. almost 2 million children die from artis each year, and most of them are from developing countries. the prevalence and correlation of pathogens in artis are poorly understood, but are critical for improving case prevention, treatment, and management. in this study, we investigated the prevalence and correlation of infectious agents in children with artis. a total of 39,756 children with one or more symptoms, including fever, cough, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, herpangina, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis, were enrolled in the study. all patients were hospitalized in wuhan children's hospital between october 1, 2010 and september 30, 2012, and were evaluated for infectious agents. pathogens, including mycoplasma pneumoniae, influenza a virus, influenza b virus, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, legionella pneumophila, chlamydophila pneumoniae, and coxiella burnetii, were screened simultaneously in patient blood samples using anti-pathogen igm tests. regression analysis was used to reveal correlations among the pathogens. our results showed that one or more pathogens were identified in 10,206 patients, and that mycoplasma pneumoniae, adenoviruses, and influenza b virus were the leading infectious agents. mixed-infections of pathogens were detected in 2,391 cases, with mycoplasma pneumoniae as the most frequent pathogen. the most common agents in the co-infections were mycoplasma pneumoniae and influenza b virus. regression analysis revealed a linear correlation between the proportion of mixed infections and the incidence of multi-pathogen infections. the prevalence of infectious agents in children with artis was determined. equations were established to estimate multiple infections by single-pathogen detection. this revealed a linear correlation for pathogens in children with artis. this study provides useful information for improving case prevention and management.","Jia Liu, Hongwu Ai 2☯, Ying Xiong, Fu Li, Zhou Wen, Weiyong Liu, Tongya Li, Kai Qin, Jianguo Wu, Yingle Liu, Liu J , Ai H Xiong, Y Li, F , Wen Z Liu, W , Charles J Russell, St Jude"

7435,molecules Iron Transport Tocopheryl Polyethylene Glycol Succinate in Animal Health and Diseases,"abstractgut health is the starting place for maintaining the overall health of an animal. strategies to maintain gut health are, thus, an important part in achieving the goal of improving animal health. a new strategy to do this involves two molecules: the iron transport protein ovotransferrin (it) and α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (tpgs), which result in the novel formulation of itpgs. these molecules help reduce gut pathogens, while enhancing the absorption and bioavailability of therapeutic drugs, phytomedicines, and nanomedicines. this, in turn, helps to maintain normal health in animals. maintaining the gastrointestinal tract (git) in its normal condition is key for successful absorption and efficacy of any nutrient. a compromised git, due to an imbalance (dysbiosis) in the git microbiome, can lead to an impaired gi barrier system with impaired absorption and overall health of the animal. the molecules in itpgs may address the issue of poor absorption by keeping the gi system healthy by maintaining the normal microbiome and improving the absorption of nutrients through multiple mechanisms involving antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antimicrobial activities. the itpgs technology can allow the dose of active pharmaceutical or herbal medicine to be significantly reduced in order to attain equal or better efficacy. with complimentary actions between it and tpgs, itpgs presents a novel approach to increase the bioavailability of drugs, phytoconstituents, nutrients, and nanomedicines by enhanced transport to the tissues at the site of action, while reducing gut pathogen load. the itpgs approach appears to be a novel strategy for maintaining the health of animals by manipulation of microbiota.molecules 2019, 24, 4289 2 of 20 bioenhancers of herbal and non-herbal origins are indicated for drugs and

or potentiate the plasma concentration of drugs) mentioned in ayurvedic medicine     . in other in vivo studies, peppermint oil has been reported to increase bioavailability of cyclosporine  , and ginseng polysaccharides have been reported to enhance absorption of ginsenoside rb1  .in in vivo studies, yurdakok-dikmen et al.  reported that following oral administration, the biodegradation of herbal drugs occurs in the stomach or gut lumen, where membrane permeability and metabolism are key factors in absorption. bioenhancers are from various classes and exert their effects via multiple mechanisms, such as enzymatic alterations, phytosome formulations, transporter protein alterations, cholagogue/cholerectic effect, and thermogenesis. absorption of drugs/phytoconstituents can be enhanced by employing various strategies, such as manipulating formulation (micronization, nanocrystals/nanosuspensions, solid solutions, self-dispersing solid solutions with surfactants, lipid solutions, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems, and surfactant-cosolvent systems)  21] .in a number of in vivo studies, properties of tpgs (vitamin e tpgs) have been described to enhance the delivery of drugs, nutraceuticals, nanoparticles, and dietary nutrients  22] . the poor water solubility of vitamin e limits its absorption in the git, but esterification of vitamin e succinate with polyethylene glycol (peg) 1000 makes it completely water soluble     . tpgs has an amphiphilic structure comprising of a hydrophilic polar head portion and lipophilic alkyl tail. it can be functionalized as an excellent solubilizer, emulsifier, and permeation and bioavailability enhancer of hydrophobic drugs and nutraceuticals      . tpgs can also be used in the development of nanomedicines, focusing on simple structures with multifunctional properties  29, 30] . of course, the preparation of nanomedicines is still at the laboratory scale and progress on developing novel nanomedicines is relatively slow. in both in vitro and in vivo studies, tpgs has also been shown to exhibit additional properties, such as a surfactant, apoptogenic, anticancer, immunomodulator, neuroprotection, and reversal of multidrug resistance (mdr) by inhibiting p-glycoprotein (p-gp) activity  29,       . tpgs 1000 (1000 denoting the peg chain molecular weight) has been approved by the fda as a gras supplement to solubilize drugs in oral, parenteral, topical, nasal, and rectal/vaginal therapies     . tpgs has also been approved by the european food safety authority (efsa) as a safe pharmaceutical adjuvant used in drug formulation and for research purposes    .vitamin e tpgs is a powerful tool in the formulation of poorly-soluble lipophilic compounds, as it enhances absorption and bioavailability via efficient micellar uptake into enterocytes. tpgs has a proven record of safety and efficacy in pharmaceutical, dietary supplement, food and beverage, personal care, animal nutrition, and cannabinoid products. it has the added benefit of being a clean label ingredient. in order to achieve greater stability, bioavailability, additional biological/pharmacological effects, and better therapeutic efficacy, tpgs technology has been further improvised by combining the iron transport (it) protein of ovotransferrin with tpgs. the formulation of iron transport polyethylene glycol succinate (itpgs) is soluble in both fat and water and exerts multiple biological and pharmacological effects, such as antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, healthy

4512,Application of Consensus Scoring and Principal Component Analysis for Virtual Screening against b- Secretase (BACE-1),"abstractbackground: in order to identify novel chemical classes of b-secretase (bace-1) inhibitors, an alternative scoring protocol, principal component analysis (pca), was proposed to summarize most of the information from the original scoring functions and re-rank the results from the virtual screening against bace-1.method: given a training set (50 bace-1 inhibitors and 9950 inactive diverse compounds), three rank-based virtual screening methods, individual scoring, conventional consensus scoring and pca, were judged by the hit number in the top 1% of the ranked list. the docking poses were generated by surflex, five scoring functions (surflex_score, d_score, g_score, chemscore, and pmf_score) were used for pose extraction. for each pose group, twelve scoring functions (surflex_score, d_score, g_score, chemscore, pmf_score, ligscore1, ligscore2, plp1, plp2, jain, ludi_1, and ludi_2) were used for the pose rank. for a test set, 113,228 chemical compounds (sigma-aldrichh corporate chemical directory) were docked by surflex, then ranked by the same three ranking methods motioned above to select the potential active compounds for experimental test.results: for the training set, the pca approach yielded consistently superior rankings compared to conventional consensus scoring and single scoring. for the test set, the top 20 compounds according to conventional consensus scoring were experimentally tested, no inhibitor was found. then, we relied on pca scoring protocol to test another different top 20 compounds and two low micromolar inhibitors (s450588 and 276065) were emerged through the bace-1 fluorescence resonance energy transfer (fret) assay.the pca method extends the conventional consensus scoring in a quantitative statistical manner and would appear to have considerable potential for chemical screening applications.citation: liu s, fu r, zhou l-h, chen s-p (2012) application of consensus scoring and principal component analysis for virtual screening against b-secretase (bace-1). plos one 7(6): e38086.","Shu Liu, Rao Fu, Li-Hua Zhou, Sheng-Ping Chen"
405,Innate Immune Priming by cGAS as a Preparatory Countermeasure Against 1 RNA Virus Infection 2 3,"abstractthe detection of nucleic acids by pattern recognition receptors is an ancient and 27 conserved component of the innate immune system. notably, rna virus genomes 28 are sensed by mammalian cytosolic rig-i-like receptors, thereby activating 29 interferon-stimulated gene (isg) expression to restrict viral replication. however, 30 recent evidence indicates that the cgas-sting dna sensing pathway also 31 protects against rna viruses. so far, the mechanisms responsible for dna sensing 32 of rna viruses, which replicate without known dna intermediates, remain unclear. 33by using cgas gene knockout and reconstitution in human and mouse cell 34, we discovered that dna sensing and cgamp synthase activities are 35 required for cgas-mediated restriction of vesicular stomatitis virus and sindbis 36 virus. the level of cgamp produced in response to rna virus infection was below 37 the threshold of detection, suggesting that only transient and/or low levels of 38 cgamp are produced during rna virus infections. to clarify the dna ligands that 39 activate cgas activity, we confirmed that cgas binds mitochondrial dna in the 40 cytosol of both uninfected and infected cells; however, the amount of 41 cgas-associated mitochondrial dna did not change in response to virus infection. 42 rather, a variety of pre-existing cytosolic dnas, including mitochondrial dna and 43 endogenous cdnas, may serve as stimuli for basal cgas activation. importantly, 44 cgas knockout and reconstitution experiments demonstrated that cgas drives 45 low-level isg expression at steady state. we propose that cgas-sting restricts 46 rna viruses by promoting a preparatory immune activation state within cells, likely 47 primed by endogenous cellular dna ligands. 48 . importance 49 many medically important rna viruses are restricted by the cgas-sting 50 dna-sensing pathway of innate immune activation. since these viruses replicate 51 without dna intermediates, it is unclear what dna ligand(s) are responsible for 52 triggering this pathway. we show here that cgas's dna binding and signaling 53 activities are required for rna virus restriction, similar to the mechanisms by which it 54 restricts dna viruses. furthermore, we confirmed that cgas continuously binds host 55 dna, which was unaffected by rna virus infection. finally, cgas expression 56correlated with the low-level expression of interferon-stimulated genes in uninfected 57 cells, both in vitro and in vivo. we propose that cgas-mediated sensing of 58 endogenous dna ligands contributes to rna virus restriction by establishing a 59 baseline of innate immune activation. doi: biorxiv preprint 61 a key feature of innate immunity is the detection of pathogen-associated 62 molecular patterns (pamps) by pattern recognition receptors (prrs) (1). for 63 mammalian cells, viral nucleic acids are detected by distinct prrs, triggering 64 interferon-stimulated gene (isg) expression to set up an antiviral state. during rna 65 virus infections, uncapped and double-stranded rnas are detected in the cytosol by 66 the prrs retinoic acid-inducible gene i (rig-i) and related rig-i-like receptors 67 (rlrs). however, the recent discovery of the cgas-sting cytosolic dna sensing 68 pathway, and the observation that it can also restrict rna viruses (2), reveals a need 69 to further investigate the mechanisms of nucleic acid sensing during rna virus 70 infection. 71 the stimulator of interferon genes (sting) is an endoplasmic reticulum-and 72 mitochondrial-bound protein that spontaneously activates isg expression when 73 overexpressed (2). although sting is involved in dna sensing, sting -/mice and 74 mouse endothelial fibroblasts (mefs) are more permissive for vesicular stomatitis 75 virus (vsv), a negative-stand rna virus (2, 3). additionally, studies in mefs 76 deficient in three prime repair exonuclease 1 (trex1), a nuclease important for the 77 turnover of cytosolic retroelement cdnas (4), have described enhanced antiviral 78 phenotypes in response to a wide array of rna viruses and retroviruses, 79presumably due to the accumulation of dna in the cytosol (5, 6). it appears that this 80 dna-based restriction is broad, as many rna viruses have evolved mechanisms to 81 subvert the cgas-sting pathway, including flaviviruses (7-9), hepaciviruses (10, 82sting does not directly interact with cytosolic dna, but functions as an innate 84 immune adaptor protein to transduce signals between cyclic gmp-amp synthase 85 (cgas) and tank-binding kinase 1, which subsequently phosphorylates the 86 transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (irf3) to initiate an isg response

restriction (figure 3d-3f). as observed previously in mefs, vsvδm51a-gfp was 161 more potently restricted than vsv-gfp, but unlike in mefs, infected fewer cells 162 expressing mutant cgas. this was also true for sinv-gfp, albeit restriction with 163 wt hcgas-ha3x was extremely potent, comparatively. it is unclear whether these 164 modest decreases in infection of the cgas mutants was due to hcgas-ha3x 165 overexpression in thp-1 cells, residual hcgas activities, or normal clonal 166 variation of cells. nevertheless, these results are most consistent with an integral 167 role for cgas dna binding and cgamp synthase activities in rna virus restriction. 168 detection of cgamp produced in response to dna transfection but not 169 rna virus infection. because cgamp synthesis activity was essential for rna 170 virus restriction, we next sought to identify cgamp produced in response to rna . 676 2013. the papain-like protease of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus negatively 677 regulates

12065,The Porcine Deltacoronavirus Replication Organelle Comprises Double-Membrane Vesicles and Zippered Endoplasmic Reticulum with Double-Membrane Spherules,"abstractporcine deltacoronavirus (pdcov) was first identified in hong kong in 2012 from samples taken from pigs in 2009. pdcov was subsequently identified in the usa in 2014 in pigs with a history of severe diarrhea. the virus has now been detected in pigs in several countries around the world. following the development of tissue culture adapted strains of pdcov, it is now possible to address questions regarding virus-host cell interactions for this genera of coronavirus. here, we presented a detailed study of pdcov-induced replication organelles. all positive-strand rna viruses induce the rearrangement of cellular membranes during virus replication to support viral rna synthesis, forming the replication organelle. replication organelles for the alpha-, beta-, and gammacoronavirus genera have been characterized. all coronavirus genera induced the formation of double-membrane vesicles (dmvs). in addition, alphaand betacoronaviruses induce the formation of convoluted membranes, while gammacoronaviruses induce the formation of zippered endoplasmic reticulum (er) with tethered double-membrane spherules. however, the structures induced by deltacoronaviruses, particularly the presence of convoluted membranes or double-membrane spherules, are unknown. initially, the dynamics of pdcov strain oh-fd22 replication were assessed with the onset of viral rna synthesis, protein synthesis, and progeny particle release determined. subsequently, virus-induced membrane rearrangements were identified in infected cells by electron microscopy. as has been observed for all other coronaviruses studied to date, pdcov replication was found to induce the formation of double-membrane vesicles. significantly, however, pdcov replication was also found to induce the formation of regions of zippered endoplasmic reticulum, small associated tethered vesicles, and double-membrane spherules. these structures strongly resemble the replication organelle induced by avian gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus.ro formation and function are critical steps in the replication cycle of all +rna viruses. the membrane origin, shape, and structure of ros varies between different virus families, but there are common themes in the types of structure produced. several viruses, including enteroviruses, arteriviruses, toroviruses, hepatitis c virus, and foot and mouth disease virus, induce the formation of double-membrane vesicles (dmvs), often along with single-membrane vesicles and tubules or paired membranes       . the second type of structure which are commonly induced are spherules or invaginated vesicles, which are formed by alphaviruses, flaviviruses, bromoviruses, and nodaviruses  4,      . these are small single-membrane vesicles which are pinched out from a cellular membrane, but they remain tethered to the membrane and possess a channel connecting the interior of the spherule with the cytoplasm.an important family of +rna viruses are the coronaviruses. coronaviruses infect a wide range of species, including swine, cattle, poultry, dogs, cats, horses, and humans, causing economically damaging diseases impacting livestock farming industries, significant companion animal morbidity, and important human illnesses. in the last 17 years, two novel coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), have emerged into the human population from zoonotic sources (bats via civets and camels, respectively) and have caused significant illnesses with high mortality rates  17] . this, along with the recent emergence of swine acute diarrhea syndrome (sads)-cov in pigs arising after a species jump  19] , highlights the importance of this family of viruses as a threat to human health with the potential for further emergence of new pathogenic viruses. there are four genera within the coronavirus family, alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and deltacoronaviruses, and the ros of viruses within these genera have been characterized. all coronaviruses induce the formation of dmvs. in addition, there are rearrangements of the endoplasmic reticulum (er) to form either a branching network of membranes, referred to as convoluted membranes (cm) found in alphaand betacoronavirus infected cells     , or paired er membranes, referred to as zippered er in gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (ibv) infected cells identified in our previous work  25] . small double-membrane spherules, not seen previously in cells infected with other coronaviruses, are associated with the zippered er in ibv-infected cells are.deltacoronaviruses were first characterized as a new coronavirus genus in 2011. the majority of members of this genus infect avian species and have been identified only through sequencing the viral genome. therefore, in the absence of viral isolates able to replicate in cell culture, studying the virus-host interactions of this genus of coronaviruses has not been possible. however, porcine deltacoronavirus (pdcov) was identified in hong kong in 2012  , and subsequently from pigs in the usa and other countries      . the virus causes an acute gastrointestinal infection with severe diarrhea, vomiting, and atrophic enteritis  . importantly, cell culture adapted strains of pdcov have now been developed    , allowing the characterization of how this genus of coronaviruses interacts with its host cell, including a characterization of the deltacoronavirus ro. in a recent publication, qin et. al. confirmed the presence of dmvs in pdcov infected cells  . however, neither cm nor zippered er and spherules were identified. here, we characterized pdcov stain oh-fd22  replication in porcine llc-pk1 cells, including a detailed characterization of ros.materials and methodsporcine llc-pk1 cells (atcc cl-101)  were maintained in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (dmem; sigma aldrich, gillingham, uk) supplemented with 10% fcs (sigma aldrich). porcine deltacoronavirus oh-fd22 was kindly provided by prof. linda saif, the ohio state university  34] . viral infection of llc-pk1 cells was performed in emem supplemented with 1% hepes, 1% neaa, and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic with 2.5-10 µg/ml trypsin. when approximately 80% cpe was visible, cells and culture media were harvested, freeze/thawed twice, and cell debris were pelleted. viral stocks were titrated by tissue culture infectious dose 50 (tcid 50 ).","Nicole Doyle, Philippa C Hawes, Jennifer Simpson, Lorin H Adams, Helena J Maier"

1549,"Drug Design, Development and Therapy Dovepress Xyloketal B, a marine compound, acts on a network of molecular proteins and regulates the activity and expression of rat cytochrome P450 3a: a bioinformatic and animal study","abstractnatural compounds are becoming popular for the treatment of illnesses and health promotion, but the mechanisms of action and safety profiles are often unknown. xyloketal b (xkb) is a novel marine compound isolated from the mangrove fungus xylaria sp., with potent antioxidative, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective effects. however, its molecular targets and effects on drug-metabolizing enzymes are unknown. this study aimed to investigate the potential molecular targets of xkb using bioinformatic approaches and to examine the effect of xkb on the expression and activity of rat cytochrome p450 3a (cyp3a) subfamily members using midazolam as a model probe. ddi-cpi, a server that can predict drug-drug interactions via the chemical-protein interactome, was employed to predict the targets of xkb, and the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery (david) was used to analyze the pathways of the predicted targets of xkb. homology modeling was performed using the discovery studio program 3.1. the activity and expression of rat hepatic cyp3a were examined after the rats were treated with xkb at 7 and 14 mg/kg for 8 consecutive days. rat plasma concentrations of midazolam and its metabolite 1′-oh-midazolam were determined using a validated high-performance liquid chromatographic method. bioinformatic analysis showed that there were over 324 functional proteins and 61 related signaling pathways that were potentially regulated by xkb. a molecular docking study showed that xkb bound to the active site of human cytochrome p450 3a4 and rat cyp3a2 homology model via the formation of hydrogen bonds. the in vivo study showed that oral administration of xkb at 14 mg/kg to rats for 8 days significantly increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc) of midazolam, with a concomitant decrease in the plasma clearance and auc ratio of 1′-oh-midazolam over midazolam. further, oral administration of 14 mg/kg xkb for 8 days markedly reduced the activity and expression of hepatic cyp3a in rats. taken together, the results show that xkb could regulate networks of molecular proteins and related signaling pathways and that xkb downregulated hepatic cyp3a in rats. xkb might cause drug interactions through modulation of the activity and expression of cyp3a members. more studies are warranted to confirm the mechanisms of action of xkb and to investigate the underlying mechanism for the regulating effect of xkb on cyp3a subfamily members. drug design, development and therapy

index, such as digoxin, warfarin, and carboplatin. 7,8 the rat cyp3a subfamily contains cyp3a1, 3a2, 3a9, and 3a62.both rat cyp3a1 and 3a2 have 72% identity in amino acid sequence to human cyp3a4 and share a lot of substrate specificity and inhibitor selectivity with cyp3a4. 9,10 cardiovascular disease (cvd), such as coronary heart disease and stroke, is the leading cause of death throughout the world. about 17.3 million people died from cvd in 2008, accounting for 30% of all global deaths. 11, 12 of these, about 7.3 million deaths resulted from coronary heart disease and 6.2 million deaths were due to stroke. 11,12 the incidence of cvd is increasing, exposing individuals, family, and society to a great burden. the pathogenesis of cvd is complicated, and oxidative stress has been proposed to be a causal factor in the pathogenesis. 13,14 reducing oxidative stress has been reported to be a promising strategy for the treatment of cvd. 13 a number of natural products show potent antioxidative effects, and coadministration of natural products with cardiovascular drugs has gained increasing popularity because of these effects, although there is a lack of systematic preclinical and clinical data on their pks, molecular targets, mechanisms of action, and toxicology. 15, 16 marine organisms are an attractive source for drug development. numerous compounds have been isolated from marine organisms, with a wide range of pharmacological activity, including antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. 17-18 xyloketal b (xkb, figure 1) ketoconazole

904,Title: Anesthetic agents affect urodynamic parameters and anesthetic depth at doses necessary to facilitate preclinical testing in felines,"abstracturodynamic studies, used to understand bladder function, diagnose bladder disease, and develop treatments for dysfunctions, are ideally performed with awake subjects. however, in animal models, especially cats (a common model of spinal cord injury and associated bladder pathology), anesthesia is often required for these procedures and can be a research confounder. this study compared the effects of select agents (dexmedetomidine, alfaxalone, propofol, isoflurane, and α-chloralose) on urodynamic (δpressure, bladder capacity, bladder compliance, non-voiding contractions, bladder pressure slopes) and anesthetic (change in heart rate ∆hr], average heart rate hr], reflexes, induction/recovery times) parameters in repeated cystometrograms across five adult male cats. δpressure was greatest with propofol, bladder capacity was highest with α-chloralose, non-voiding contractions were greatest with αchloralose. propofol and dexmedetomidine had the highest bladder pressure slopes during the initial and final portions of the cystometrograms respectively. cats progressed to a deeper plane of anesthesia (lower hr, smaller δhr, decreased reflexes) under dexmedetomidine, compared to propofol and alfaxalone. time to induction was shortest with propofol, and time to recovery was shortest with dexmedetomidine. these agent-specific differences in urodynamic and anesthetic parameters in cats will facilitate appropriate study-specific anesthetic choices.","Jiajie Jessica Xu, Zuha Yousuf, Zhonghua Ouyang, Eric Kennedy, Patrick A Lester, Tara Martin, Tim M Bruns"

4261,Nucleolin interacts with influenza A nucleoprotein and contributes to viral ribonucleoprotein complexes nuclear trafficking and efficient influenza viral replication OPEN,"abstractiav and the host crm1-dependent nuclear export machinery requires further exploration. recently, chase and collaborators showed that the interaction between vrnps and the nuclear export machinery takes place in dense chromatin domains that allow iav to ""snatch"" crm1-rangtp nuclear export complexes to the detriment of cellular substrates 13 . these results, together with other observations, highlight the involvement of host nuclear compartmentalization and chromatin territories in regulating nuclear traffic of iav vrnps     .several investigations, including ours, have revealed that iav induce a strong remodeling of nuclear architecture with marked modifications of the nucleoli ultrastructure and compartments 3,17-20 . the nucleolus, known as the site of ribosome biogenesis, is also a sensor of cellular stresses and is involved in several cellular pathways, such as cell-cycle regulation or apoptosis 21-23 . several dna and rna viruses, including cytoplasmic viruses are known to induce nucleolar alterations that contribute towards optimal infection 24-26 .in the context of iav, their interplay with nucleolus and selective interactions with several nucleolar components appears to be decisive in the outcome of infection 17, 20 . ozawa and colleagues demonstrated that dynamic nucleolar localization of np is functionally significant by contributing to efficient viral replication and transcription 27 . moreover, different studies have demonstrated a subtype dependent interaction between viral non-structural protein (ns1) and cellular nucleolin, suggesting a role of the nucleolar targeting functions of ns1 in iav pathogenesis 28, 29 . proteomics-based approaches have revealed changes in the nucleolar proteome of iav infected cells 5,30 and identified several nucleolar components, such as nucleolin, nucleophosmin (b23) and ribosomal proteins, as putative interactants of reconstituted iav vrnps 7 . in addition, high-throughput rnai approaches have highlighted the functional requirement of several of these nucleolar components in viral replication 31-33 .nucleolin is a multifunctional protein that contributes extensively to dna and rna regulatory mechanisms, including ribosome biogenesis, chromatin remodeling, mrna stability and translation, nuclear export of rna and protein complexes, and microrna processing 34, 35 . in this way, nucleolin takes part in several cellular functions, such as gene silencing, senescence, cell proliferation and growth 23,35-37 , and continuously shuttles between nucleolar/nuclear compartments and the cytoplasm up to the cell surface 38,39 . moreover, through its ability to associate with diverse target rnas, nucleolin is implicated in various pathological processes, particularly cancer and viral infection 40 .in this context, different functional interactions with nucleolin have been described for several dna viruses, such as poliovirus 41 , adenovirus 42 , hsv 43, 44 or cmv 45, 46 , and several rna viruses, such as hepatitis c and delta viruses 47,48 , coronavirus 49 , hpiv-3 50 , papillomavirus hpv9 51 , crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus 52 , hiv1 53 , noroviruses 54 and notably the infectious salmon anemia virus (isav) which belongs to the family orthomyxoviridae, as iav 55 . altogether, these studies highlight nucleolin as a key interacting factor that is crucial, in some cases, for viral replication and involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic export of viral genome or viral egress 44 .at first, we observed the dynamic redistribution of nucleolin from a nucleolar to a very specific nuclear polarized pattern during infection. the aim of this study was therefore to investigate the functional relationship between iav and nucleolin with regards to the nuclear traffic of vrnps and their targeting to the dense chromatin compartment 13 and in the context of the viral remodeling of the host nuclear architectures 17,20 . we first characterized np, the main component of iav vrnp, as co-localizing and interacting with endogenous nucleolin during infection. moreover, using cell fractionation and rnai approaches, we suggest that nucleolin contributes to efficient vrnp trafficking and viral replication. based on our results, we propose nucleolin as an essential host factor for the chromatin targeting of the nucleocytoplasmic export complex of vrnps during infection.","Olivier Terrier, Coralie Carron, Benoît De Chassey, Julia Dubois, Aurélien Traversier, Thomas Julien, Gaëlle Cartet, Anaïs Proust, Sabine Hacot, Denis Ressnikoff, Vincent Lotteau, Bruno Lina, Jean-Jacques Diaz, Vincent Moules, Manuel Rosa-Calatrava, Claude Bernard Lyon, France Lyon"

336,The effects of border control and quarantine measures on global spread of COVID-19,"abstractthe rapid expansion of coronavirus has been observed in many parts of the world. many newly reported cases of this new coronavirus during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases). for those cases without travel history, the risk of wider spreads through community contact is even higher. however, most population models assume a homogeneous infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases can pose a different risk to community spread.we have developed an ""easy-to-use"" mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported, secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered. using the dynamics of the secondary cases, we are able to determine the probability of community spread.using the top 10 visiting cities from wuhan in china as an example, we first demonstrated that the arrival time and the dynamics of the outbreaks at these cities can be successfully predicted under the reproductive number r 0 = 2.92 and latent period τ = 5.2 days. next, we showed that although control measures can gain extra 32.5 and 44.0 days in arrival time through a high intensive border control measure and a shorter time to quarantine under a low r 0 (1.4), if the r 0 is higher (2.92), only 10 extra days can be gained for each of the same measures.this suggests the importance of lowering the incidence at source regions together with infectious disease control measures in susceptible regions. the study allows us to assess the effects of border control and quarantine measures on the emergence and the global spread in a fully connected world using the dynamics of the secondary cases.2 . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.(which was not peer-reviewed) the copyright holder for this preprint .","M Pear Hossain, Alvin Junus, Xiaolin Zhu, Pengfei Jia, Tzai-Hung Wen, Dirk Pfeiffer, Hsiang-Yu Yuan, Hong Kong"

2334,Elevated hepatic DPP4 activity promotes insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,"abstractobjective: increased hepatic expression of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4) is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld). whether this is causative for the development of nafld is not yet clarified. here we investigate the effect of hepatic dpp4 overexpression on the development of liver steatosis in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. methods: plasma dpp4 activity of subjects with or without nafld was analyzed. wild-type (wt) and liver-specific dpp4 transgenic mice (dpp4-liv-tg) were fed a high-fat diet and characterized for body weight, body composition, hepatic fat content and insulin sensitivity. in vitro experiments on hepg2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes were conducted to validate cell autonomous effects of dpp4 on lipid storage and insulin sensitivity. results: subjects suffering from insulin resistance and nafld show an increased plasma dpp4 activity when compared to healthy controls. analysis of dpp4-liv-tg mice revealed elevated systemic dpp4 activity and diminished active glp-1 levels. they furthermore show increased body weight, fat mass, adipose tissue inflammation, hepatic steatosis, liver damage and hypercholesterolemia. these effects were accompanied by increased expression of pparg and cd36 as well as severe insulin resistance in the liver. in agreement, treatment of hepg2 cells and primary hepatocytes with physiological concentrations of dpp4 resulted in impaired insulin sensitivity independent of lipid content. conclusions: our results give evidence that elevated expression of dpp4 in the liver promotes nafld and insulin resistance. this is linked to reduced levels of active glp-1, but also to auto-and paracrine effects of dpp4 on hepatic insulin signaling.

4285,Effect of Pullet Vaccination on Development and Longevity of Immunity,"abstractavian respiratory disease causes significant economic losses in commercial poultry. because of the need to protect long-lived poultry against respiratory tract pathogens from an early age, vaccination programs for pullets typically involve serial administration of a variety of vaccines, including infectious bronchitis virus (ibv), newcastle disease virus (ndv), and infectious laryngotracheitis virus (iltv). often the interval between vaccinations is only a matter of weeks, yet it is unknown whether the development of immunity and protection against challenge when vaccines are given in short succession occurs in these birds, something known as viral interference. our objective was to determine whether serially administered, live attenuated vaccines against ibv, ndv, and iltv influence the development and longevity of immunity and protection against challenge in long-lived birds. based on a typical pullet vaccination program, specific-pathogen-free white leghorns were administered multiple live attenuated vaccines against ibv, ndv, and iltv until 16 weeks of age (woa), after which certain groups were challenged with ibv, ndv, or iltv at 20, 24, 28, 32, and 36 woa. five days post-challenge, viral load, clinical signs, ciliostasis, tracheal histopathology, and antibody titers in serum and tears were evaluated. we demonstrate that pullets serially administered live attenuated vaccines against ibv, ndv, and iltv were protected against homologous challenge with ibv, ndv, or iltv for at least 36 weeks, and conclude that the interval between vaccinations used in this study (at least 2 weeks) did not interfere with protection. this information is important because it shows that a typical pullet vaccination program consisting of serially administered live attenuated vaccines against multiple respiratory pathogens can result in the development of protective immunity against each disease agent.","Emily J Aston, Brian J Jordan, Susan M Williams, Maricarmen García, Mark W Jackwood"
8696,Enhanced Ability of Oligomeric Nanobodies Targeting MERS Coronavirus Receptor-Binding Domain,"abstractmiddle east respiratory syndrome (mers) coronavirus (mers-cov), an infectious coronavirus first reported in 2012, has a mortality rate greater than 35%. therapeutic antibodies are key tools for preventing and treating mers-cov infection, but to date no such agents have been approved for treatment of this virus. nanobodies (nbs) are camelid heavy chain variable domains with properties distinct from those of conventional antibodies and antibody fragments. we generated two oligomeric nbs by linking two or three monomeric nbs (mono-nbs) targeting the mers-cov receptor-binding domain (rbd), and compared their rbd-binding affinity, rbd-receptor binding inhibition, stability, and neutralizing and cross-neutralizing activity against mers-cov. relative to mono-nb, dimeric nb (di-nb) and trimeric nb (tri-nb) had significantly greater ability to bind mers-cov rbd proteins with or without mutations in the rbd, thereby potently blocking rbd-mers-cov receptor binding. the engineered oligomeric nbs were very stable under extreme conditions, including low or high ph, protease (pepsin), chaotropic denaturant (urea), and high temperature. importantly, di-nb and tri-nb exerted significantly elevated broad-spectrum neutralizing activity against at least 19 human and camel mers-cov strains isolated in different countries and years. overall, the engineered nbs could be developed into effective therapeutic agents for prevention and treatment of mers-cov infection.(>35%) ( this situation calls for a consistent effort to develop effective countermeasures, including therapeutic antibodies and vaccines, to prevent and treat mers-cov infection.mers-cov spike (s) protein, an enveloped glycoprotein, plays a key role in viral infection, viral attachment, and viral entry  15] . it is composed of s1 and s2 subunits: the receptor-binding domain (rbd) in the s1 subunit mediates mers-cov binding to its cellular receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4), and the s2 subunit subsequently mediates viral and cell membrane fusion, leading to viral entry into target cells      . the rbd of mers-cov s protein contains a critical neutralizing domain fragment capable of inducing strong neutralizing antibodies, and it is therefore considered to be an important therapeutic and vaccine target       .several monoclonal antibodies (mabs) have been developed to prevent and treat mers-cov infection, and most of these agents are based on the rbd -31]. however, conventional igg mabs and antibody fragments often have complex structures and unstable behavior    . consequently, anti-mers-cov therapeutic antibodies with strong stability and simplified structures would be clinically valuable.camelid heavy chain variable domains (vhhs), also termed nanobodies (nbs), are derived from the variable domains of the camelid heavy chain-only antibodies (hcabs). these antibodies have distinctive properties, including high binding affinity, strong specificity for target antigens, good tissue penetration, and intrinsic stability under harsh conditions, such as extreme ph values, proteases, chemicals, and high temperature. accordingly, they represent promising therapeutic tools for the treatment of human diseases    . moreover, because nbs do not require paired light and heavy chain domains to maintain antigen-binding activity, they can be easily modified by protein engineering techniques without loss of functionality  . several monomeric nbs can be readily fused to form multivalent or multispecific constructs, thereby improving their binding affinity and functionality. for example, monomeric proteins have been engineered into dimeric or trimeric proteins  39] . also, multidomain nbs have been generated by linking different nbs targeting influenza virus hemagglutinin protein; the resultant agents have greater breadth, avidity, potency, and cross-neutralizing activity against divergent influenza viruses than the parent molecules  , demonstrating the feasibility of engineering nbs targeting multiple epitopes to increase their activity. it is therefore worthwhile to attempt to generate multidomain nbs with improved activity against other emerging and re-emerging infectious viruses.previously, by immunizing llamas with a recombinant mers-cov rbd protein, we generated a monomeric nb (mono-nb, nbms10) that targets the rbd of . in this study, we constructed two oligomeric nbs, including dimeric nb (di-nb) and trimeric nb (tri-nb), and compared them to the mono-nb in terms of their ability to bind rbd proteins, inhibit rbd-dpp4 receptor binding, and cross-neutralize mers-cov infection. in addition, to demonstrate the advantages of the oligomeric nbs relative to conventional antibodies, we evaluated the stability of these nbs under the extreme conditions mentioned above. overall, our data show that the engineered oligomeric nbs have been significantly improved from the standpoint of binding affinity to the rbd, inhibition of the rbd-dpp4 binding, and cross-neutralizing activity against divergent strains of mers-cov. they also maintained greater ph, protease, chemical, and thermal stability than their mab counterparts.materials and methodsdimeric and trimeric nbs specific for mers-cov rbd were constructed by linking two or three monomeric nb (mono-nb: nbms10)  with a ggggs linker and a c-terminal his 6 tag followed by insertion into the pichia pastoris yeast secretory expression vector ppiczαa (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa). the recombinant nbs were expressed in pichia pastoris gs115 cells and purified using ni-nta columns (ge healthcare, cincinnati, oh, usa).","Lei He, Wanbo Tai, Jiangfan Li, Yuehong Chen, Yaning Gao, Junfeng Li, Shihui Sun, Yusen Zhou, Lanying Du, Guangyu Zhao"

7673,Evaluation of reference genes for real-time quantitative PCR studies in Candida glabrata following azole treatment,"abstractbackground: the selection of stable and suitable reference genes for real-time quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) is a crucial prerequisite for reliable gene expression analysis under different experimental conditions. the present study aimed to identify reference genes as internal controls for gene expression studies by rt-qpcr in azole-stimulated candida glabrata.the expression stability of 16 reference genes under fluconazole stress was evaluated using fold change and standard deviation computations with the hkgfinder tool. our data revealed that the mrna expression levels of three ribosomal rnas (rdn5.8, rdn18, and rdn25) remained stable in response to fluconazole, while pgk1, ubc7, and ubc13 mrnas showed only approximately 2.9-, 3.0-, and 2.5-fold induction by azole, respectively. by contrast, mrna levels of the other 10 reference genes (act1, ef1α, gapdh, ppia, rpl2a, rpl10, rpl13a, sdha, tub1, and ubc4) were dramatically increased in c. glabrata following antifungal treatment, exhibiting changes ranging from 4.5-to 32.7-fold. we also assessed the expression stability of these reference genes using the 2 -δδct method and three other software packages. the stability rankings of the reference genes by genorm and the 2 -δδct method were identical to those by hkgfinder, whereas the stability rankings by bestkeeper and normfinder were notably different. we then validated the suitability of six candidate reference genes (act1, pgk1, rdn5.8, rdn18, ubc7, and ubc13) as internal controls for ten target genes in this system using the comparative c t method. our validation experiments passed for all six reference genes analyzed except rdn18, where the amplification efficiency of rdn18 was different from that of the ten target genes. finally, we demonstrated that the relative quantification of target gene expression varied according to the endogenous control used, highlighting the importance of the choice of internal controls in such experiments.we recommend the use of rdn5.8, ubc13, and pgk1 alone or the combination of rdn5.8 plus ubc13 or pgk1 as reference genes for rt-qpcr analysis of gene expression in c. glabrata following azole treatment. in contrast, we show that act1 and other commonly used reference genes (gapdh, ppia, rpl13a, tub1, etc.) were not validated as good internal controls in the current model.","Qingdi Quentin Li, Jeff Skinner, John E Bennett"

4511,Fungal diseases as neglected pathogens: A wake-up call to public health officials,"abstracthuman fungal diseases differ fundamentally from other infections in diverse ways. as eukaryotic pathogens, fungi share many similarities with their host cells, which impairs the development of antifungal compounds. fungal tropism is highly variable, as pathogens infect a wide range of cell types. a single fungal pathogen can infect multiple tissues in the same patient (depending on the host's immunological status) and can undergo morphogenic shifts during infection. fungi are still underappreciated as major pathogens by both the public and public health officials. diseases caused by protozoa, bacteria, and viruses have been recognized as important public health issues for centuries. for instance, syphilis, influenza, and chagas disease have been documented for over 100 years , while invasive mycoses were only widely acknowledged as medically important pathogens in the 1980s . viral diseases of major population impact (such as smallpox, influenza and-more recentlydengue, zika, chikungunya, and coronavirus) have affected millions of people with significant effects on human health in developed, developing, and less developed nations  4] . these conditions have boosted the generation of knowledge, which has led to the eradication of smallpox , the wide availability of effective vaccines  , and the development of diagnostic and preventive tools against influenza  and, more recently, zika . bacterial diseases have profoundly impacted human health at different times in history, and although the phenomenon of antimicrobial resistance is a matter of extreme concern, there are several effective tools for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of bacterial infections . human parasitosis have been recognized to negatively impact public health in different parts of the globe for decades, which has stimulated the ongoing development of vaccines, new drugs, and diagnostic tests for malaria, sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis, filariasis, and chagas disease  . fungal infections, however, are part of a different scenario. these diseases, for most of recorded history as well as the majority of the last century, have been rare or had a low impact on human health.the increase in the number of immunocompromised patients, some of whom are highly susceptible to fungal infections, has totally changed this picture. the invasive diseases caused by fungi, the so-called systemic mycoses, profoundly impact human health. moreover, the global action fund for fungal infections (gaffi) also highlights the devastating impact of focal fungal diseases in individuals who often have intact immune systems. gaffi estimates that more than 1 million eyes go blind each year due to fungal keratitis  . nearly one billion people have skin mycoses, which makes this disease only slightly less common on the planet than headaches and dental caries. fungal spores contribute to significant reactive airway diseases in over 10 million individuals. in total, the gaffi estimates that over 300 million people plos neglected tropical diseases |","Marcio L Rodriguesid, Joshua D Nosanchuk"

11834,"Quality and quantity of dromedary camel DNA sampled from whole-blood, saliva, and tail- hair","abstractcamels are livestock with unique adaptations to hot-arid regions. to effectively study camel traits, a biobank of camel dna specimens with associated biological information is needed. we examined whole-blood, saliva (buccal swabs), and tail-hair follicle samples to determine which is the best source for establishing a dna biobank. we inspected five amounts of each of whole-blood, buccal swabs, and tail-hair follicles in nine camels, both qualitatively via gel electrophoresis and quantitatively using a nanodrop spectrophotometer. we also tested the effects of long term-storage on the quality and quantity of dna, and measured the rate of degradation, by analyzing three buccal swab samples and 30 tail-hair follicles over a period of nine months. good quality dna, in the form of visible large size dna bands, was extracted from all three sources, for all five amounts. the five volumes of whole-blood samples (20-100μl) provided~0.4-3.6 μg, the five quantities of buccal swabs (1-5) produced 0.1-12 μg, while the five amounts of tail-hair follicles (10-50) resulted in~0.7-25 μg. no differences in the rate of degradation of buccal swab and tail-hair follicle dna were detected, but there was clearly greater deterioration in the quality of dna extracted from buccal swabs when compared to tail-hair follicles. we recommend using tail-hair samples for camel dna biobanking, because it resulted in both an adequate quality and quantity of dna, along with its ease of collection, transportation, and storage. compared to its success in studies of other domesticated animals, we anticipate that using~50 tail-hair follicles will provide sufficient dna for sequencing or snp genotyping.camels tolerate heat through the insulation provided by their coats, along with exhibiting variable body temperature (34-40˚c)  4] . adaptations to aridity in camels include tolerating water loss , having high drinking capacity, producing low amounts of urine, minimizing respiratory water loss  , and maintaining the volume and function of red blood cells regardless of the water content in the blood stream  7] . the aforementioned adaptations make camels the livestock of choice in the hot deserts of asia and africa  . camels are utilized for the production of milk , meat , as well as hide and skin  . camels are also used as pack animals, for transportation, for racing competitions  13] , and beauty contests  15] .so far, there have been no thorough investigation of the molecular basis of camels' traits, including desert adaptions, behavioral attributes, aesthetic traits, athletic traits, and traits of economic importance  . the dromedary camel genome has been sequenced recently  18] , which opens the door to study the camel genomically. the reference camel genome enabled the identification of genes associated with white-spotting coat color  , solid coat colors  , and ""tameness""  . the aforementioned studies employed an approach that consists of sequencing candidate genes -this approach is limited in utility and does not allow for exploring the wide-range of camel phenotypes. the candidate gene approach can be applied only when the biology of the phenotype is fully understood and a prior knowledge of candidate genes and their functions is available  . a biobank of camel dna samples, with associated phenotypes, is needed to utilize genome sequencing and snp genotyping technologies in linkage analyses  or genome-wide association studies  . moreover, validating the association and possibly the causation, of the genetic variants of a given phenotype requires genotyping a large number of individuals (positive and negative for the phenotype) and examining the agreement between their genotype and phenotype  . this validation method will benefit greatly from a camel dna biobank.dna biobanking is essential to study livestock genetics and to develop controlled breeding programs  27] . dna biobanking for genetic studies requires careful consideration of the used biological specimens, insofar as their source, and their yielded quality and quantity to enable dna genotyping and sequencing, as well as their ease of transport, and their amenability for long-term storage prior to dna extraction. another important aspect to consider when establishing a dna biobank, is the depth of the information associated with the samples collected from each specimen. such information includes age, sex, breed, pedigree information, geographic location, phenotypic attributes (e.g. coat color and texture), morphological measurements (e.g. size and height), and productivity (e.g. milk volume, carcass weight, hide quality). to this effect, we recently developed the data collection and organization application, samplease  , that aims to expedite the collection of all the necessary information associated with each dna sample in the envisioned camel biobank.dna sequencing for molecular studies were successful in using each of camel blood     , tissue  , saliva  , and hair  21] . however, the question of which dna source is most useful for camel sample biobanking still remains. we think that for the dna source to be optimal in camel biobanking, it should have the following attributes: (1) it should be easy and non-invasive to collect, (2) the collection should require no special training, (3) it should neither be pathogenic nor harmful, (4) it should provide adequate dna quantity and quality, (5) it should be amenable to long-term storage, and (6) it should be easy to transport to the lab and distribute to interested researchers.to select the best camel specimen source for establishing a dna biobank, we aimed to (1) identify the most optimal, non-invasive method of camel dna sampling, (2) assess the quantity and quality of dna obtained from whole-blood, saliva (buccal swabs), and tail-hair follicles, and (3) examine the degradation rate of the dna extracted from tail-hair and saliva, over a period of 9 months. the third aim was confined to saliva and tail-hair samples due to their camel dna from whole-blood, saliva, and tail-hair plos one |","Hasan Alhaddad Id, Tasneem Maraqa, Suha Alabdulghafour, Huda Alaskar Id, Randa Alaqeely, Faisal Almathen, Bader H Alhajeri"

3088,Animal viral diseases and global change: bluetongue and West Nile fever as paradigms,"abstractenvironmental changes have an undoubted influence on the appearance, distribution, and evolution of infectious diseases, and notably on those transmitted by vectors. global change refers to environmental changes arising from human activities affecting the fundamental mechanisms operating in the biosphere. this paper discusses the changes observed in recent times with regard to some important arboviral (arthropod-borne viral) diseases of animals, and the role global change could have played in these variations. two of the most important arboviral diseases of animals, bluetongue (bt) and west nile fever/encephalitis (wnf), have been selected as models. in both cases, in the last 15 years an important leap forward has been observed, which has lead to considering them emerging diseases in different parts of the world. bt, affecting domestic ruminants, has recently afflicted livestock in europe in an unprecedented epizootic, causing enormous economic losses. wnf affects wildlife (birds), domestic animals (equines), and humans, thus, beyond the economic consequences of its occurrence, as a zoonotic disease, it poses an important public health threat. west nile virus (wnv) has expanded in the last 12 years worldwide, and particularly in the americas, where it first occurred in 1999, extending throughout the americas relentlessly since then, causing a severe epidemic of disastrous consequences for public health, wildlife, and livestock. in europe, wnv is known long time ago, but it is since the last years of the twentieth century that its incidence has risen substantially. circumstances such as global warming, changes in land use and water management, increase in travel, trade of animals, and others, can have an important influence in the observed changes in both diseases. the following question is raised: what is the contribution of global changes to the current increase of these diseases in the world?","Miguel Á Jiménez-Clavero, Tamas Bakonyi, Michael Eschbaumer, Giovanni Savini, Miguel Á "
5781,Viral aetiology of acute respiratory infections among children and associated meteorological factors in southern China,"abstractbackground: acute respiratory infections (aris) are common in children and mostly caused by viruses, but the significance of the detection of multiple viruses in aris is unclear. this study investigated 14 respiratory viruses in aris among children and associated meteorological factors in shantou, southern china. methods: paired nasal/throat-flocked swabs collected from 1,074 children with aris, who visited outpatient walk-in clinics in a tertiary hospital between december 2010 and november 2011, were examined for fourteen respiratory viruses -influenza viruses (flua, flub), respiratory syncytial viruses (rsv a and b), human coronaviruses (hcov: 229e, oc43, hku1, nl63), human metapneumoviruses (hmpv a and b), parainfluenza viruses (piv1-4), human rhinoviruses (hrv a, b, c), enteroviruses (ev), adenoviruses (adv), human bocavirus (hbov), and human parechoviruses (hpev) -by multiplex real-time pcr.results: we identified at least one virus in 82.3% (884/1,074) and multiple viruses in 38.6% (415/1,074) of patients. ev and hrv were the most frequently detected single viruses (42.3%, 374/884 and 39.9%, 353/884 respectively) and co-detected pair (23.1%, 96/415). overlapping seasonal trends of viruses were recorded over the year, with dual peaks for ev and single peaks for the others. by logistic regression analysis, ev was positively associated with the average temperature and humidity, hcov, and piv4, but negatively with hrv, piv3, and hbov. hrv was inversely associated with ev and piv3.conclusions: this study reports high viral detection and co-detection rates in pediatric ari cases mainly due to ev and hrv. many viruses circulated throughout the year with similar seasonal trends in association with temperature, humidity, and wind velocity. statistically significant associations were present among the viruses. understanding the polyviral etiology and viral interactions in the cases with multiple viruses warrants further studies.","Binglin Cui, Dangui Zhang, Hui Pan, Fan Zhang, Jeremy Farrar, Frieda Law, H Rogier Van Doorn, Beiyan Wu, William Ba-Thein"

4236,cells Recent Advances in EPAC-Targeted Therapies: A Biophysical Perspective,"abstractthe universal second messenger camp regulates diverse intracellular processes by interacting with ubiquitously expressed proteins, such as protein kinase a (pka) and the exchange protein directly activated by camp (epac). epac is implicated in multiple pathologies, thus several epac-specific inhibitors have been identified in recent years. however, the mechanisms and molecular interactions underlying the epac inhibition elicited by such compounds are still poorly understood. additionally, being hydrophobic low molecular weight species, epac-specific inhibitors are prone to forming colloidal aggregates, which result in non-specific aggregation-based inhibition (abi) in aqueous systems. here, we review from a biophysical perspective the molecular basis of the specific and non-specific interactions of two epac antagonists-ce3f4r, a non-competitive inhibitor, and esi-09, a competitive inhibitor of epac. additionally, we discuss the value of common abi attenuators (e.g., tx and hsa) to reduce false positives at the expense of introducing false negatives when screening aggregation-prone compounds. we hope this review provides the epac community effective criteria to evaluate similar compounds, aiding in the optimization of existing drug leads, and informing the development of the next generation of epac-specific inhibitors.involved in sperm function (cris), underscoring the complexity of camp-related signaling  15] . importantly, in 1998, a new camp receptor was discovered after observing camp-dependent activation for the small gtpase rap1, which was independent of pka  . the new camp receptor, now known as the exchange protein directly activated by camp (epac), was then identified through a database screen for putative camp-binding domains  . there are two isoforms of epac (epac1 and epac2) that serve as guanine exchange factors for ras-like gtpases, primarily rap1 and rap2  17] . epac1 is more broadly expressed, e.g., in the circulatory, excretory, reproductive and digestive systems, whereas epac2 is more abundant in the central nervous system (cns), pancreas and adrenal gland  17] .epac regulates several critical camp-related signaling pathways, including cardiac calcium homeostasis, vascular remodeling, tissue homeostasis, regulation of smooth muscle contraction, insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells, integrin-dependent cell adhesion, neuronal excitability and memory consolidation in the hippocampus        . thus, epac inhibition has been recognized as a promising therapeutic route for a wide spectrum of diseases, including pancreatic cancer , breast cancer , cardiac hypertrophy , vascular inflammation , alzheimer's disease , as well as infections, e.g., coronavirus'  and malaria  . for further details about the physiological role of epac and subsequent disease implications, we refer to excellent reviews, which have been published in recent years     .given the critical role played by epac in multiple pathologies, several epac-specific modulators have been screened to target epac proteins (vide infra). despite their wide commercial availability and seemingly ubiquitous use in experimental studies, for several epac inhibitors, the molecular basis of their interactions with epac and the related mechanism of action are currently not fully understood, thus limiting further improvement on existing inhibitor design, lead optimization and epac-targeted drug development.another notable impediment in drug discovery and development  35] arises from the hydrophobic nature of the aforementioned epac inhibitors, which makes them susceptible to the formation of colloidal aggregates in a hydrophilic environment. these aggregation prone-compounds can modulate specific enzyme-substrate interactions due to non-specific enzyme-aggregate absorption, ultimately modifying enzyme activity due to protein misfolding/unfolding, decrease in free substrate concentration, alteration of effective enzyme-substrate affinity and/or physical separation of the enzyme and substrate    . overall, the phenomenon of non-specific enzyme inhibition is typically referred to as aggregation-prone inhibition (abi) and is notorious for introducing false positives in drug screens  37] as well as posing several challenges in terms of dosage optimization and drug delivery in physiological systems.many of the aforementioned epac inhibitors have shown great therapeutic potential in cell-based and in vivo models despite their propensity to form colloidal aggregates     . interestingly, several drug-like small molecules, lead compounds and even marketed drugs show aggregation-prone tendencies, particularly at micromolar concentrations  , raising the question of how the specific interactions between enzymes and enzyme-specific inhibitors are affected by the latter's aggregation-prone tendencies. moreover, it has not been conclusively determined if all ligand-aggregates involved in abi bind enzymes in the first place. thus, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of abi as well as the underlying specific enzyme:inhibitor interactions is critical to further optimize epac inhibitors.as abi is ubiquitous, several strategies have been implemented to counter aggregate formation, mainly exploiting the sensitivity of ligand aggregates to non-ionic detergents and other solubilizing agents  43] . as such, the detergent triton x100 (tx) and human or bovine serum albumin (hsa or bsa) are commonly used to attenuate false positives associated with abi in drug screens. however, they introduce the added risk of generating false negatives  44] . therefore, in addition to understanding the basis of abi when evaluating the therapeutic potential of epac-specific inhibitors (esis), if attenuators are used, awareness of the mechanism of abi attenuation is also crucial to carefully define and consider the false positive vs. false negative balance.","Alveena Ahmed, Stephen Boulton, Hongzhao Shao, Madoka Akimoto, Amarnath Natarajan, Xiaodong Cheng, Giuseppe Melacini, M A "
4320,"Nucleocapsid Interacts with NPM1 and Protects it from Proteolytic Cleavage, Enhancing Cell Survival, and is Involved in PEDV Growth OPEN","abstract(n) protein localizes specifically to the nucleolus. the mechanism of nuclear translocation, and whether n protein associates with particular nucleolar components, is unknown. in this study, we confirm that a nucleolar phosphoprotein nucleophosmin (npm1) interacts and co-localizes with the n protein in the nucleolus. in vitro binding studies indicated that aa 148-294 of n and aa 118-188 of npm1 were required for binding. interestingly, n protein importation into the nucleolus is independent of the ability of npm1 to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. furthermore, overexpression of npm1 promoted pedv growth, while knockdown of npm1 suppressed pedv growth. in addition, binding of n protein to npm1 protects it from proteolytic degradation by caspase-3, leading to increased cell survival. taken together, our studies demonstrate a specific interaction of the n protein with the host cell protein npm1 in the nucleolus. the results suggest potential linkages among viral strategies for the regulation of cell survival activities, possibly through an interaction of n protein with npm1 which prevents its proteolytic cleavage and enhances cell survival, thus ultimately promoting the replication of pedv.porcine epidemic diarrhea (ped) is an acute, highly contagious, and devastating viral enteric disease with a high mortality rate in sucking pigs. ped was first reported as a clinical entity in england in 1971 and was shown to be distinct from porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (tge) in 1977 1 . since then, outbreaks of ped have been reported in many european countries. currently, ped occurs mainly in asia, and these outbreaks are more acute and severe than those observed in europe 2 . in 2010, a large-scale outbreak of ped occurred on swine farms in china and afterwards, in may 2013, this ped virus (pedv) emerged and spread rapidly in the united states, posing significant economic and public health concerns 3 . the causal agent, pedv, is a member of the coronavirinae, which are single-stranded, positive-sense rna viruses with the largest genome known. they infect humans, other mammals, and birds, usually causing subclinical or respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. the pedv genome is composed of a 5′ untranslated region (utr), at least seven open reading frames (orf1a, orf1b, and orf2 through 6), and a 3′ utr 4 . orf1a and orf1b are located downstream of the 5′ utr and encode the viral replicase polyproteins 1a and 1b. the remaining orfs in the 3′ terminal region code for four major structural proteins, the spike (s, 180-220 kda), envelope (e, 7 kda), membrane (m, 27-32 kda), and nucleocapsid (n, 55-58 kda) proteins, respectively, and orf3 encodes an accessory protein that is thought to be associated with virulence 5 .although there has been much progress in understanding how pedv causes disease, there remains a paucity of information on the ways in which these pathogens interact with host cells during virus replication and spread. specifically, we know comparatively little about how individual pedv proteins interact with host cell factors and","Da Shi, Hongyan Shi, Dongbo Sun, Jianfei Chen, Xin Zhang, Xiaobo Wang, Jialin Zhang, Zhaoyang Ji, Jianbo Liu, Liyan Cao, Xiangdong Zhu, Jing Yuan, Hui Dong, Xin Wang, Tiecheng Chang, Ye Liu, Li Feng"
10310,In silico/In vivo analysis of high-risk papillomavirus L1 and L2 conserved sequences for development of cross-subtype prophylactic vaccine,"abstractthe major impediments such as economic barriers especially gaps in financing obstructed the optimal delivery of vaccines in developing countries. thus, many efforts are underway to develop the next generation of vaccines against other types of high-risk hpv. in this study, we developed dna constructs (based on l1 and l2 genes) that were potentially immunogenic and highly conserved among the highrisk hpv types. the framework of analysis include (1) b-cell epitope mapping, (2) t-cell epitope mapping (i.e., cd4 + and cd8 + t cells), (3) allergenicity assessment, (4) tap transport and proteasomal cleavage, (5) population coverage, (6) global and template-based docking, and (7) data collection, analysis, and design of the l1 and l2 dna constructs. our data indicated the 8-epitope candidates for helper t-cell and ctl in l1 and l2 sequences. for the l1 and l2 constructs, combination of these peptides in a single universal vaccine could involve all world population by the rate of 95.55% and 96.33%, respectively. in vitro studies showed high expression rates of multiepitope l1 (~57.86%) and l2 (~68.42%) dna constructs in hek-293t cells. moreover, in vivo studies indicated that the combination of l1 and l2 dna constructs without any adjuvant or delivery system induced effective immune responses, and protected mice against c3 tumor cells (the percentage of tumor-free mice: ~66.67%). thus, the designed l1 and l2 dna constructs would represent promising applications for hpv vaccine development.human papillomavirus (hpv) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the world and the main cause of cervical cancer. globally, 4.5% of all cancers worldwide (60,000 cases per year in men and 570,000 cases per year in women) are attributable to hpv 1 . more than 150 viral types of hpv have been identified whose classification is based on their association with cervical cancer and precursor lesions. hpv types were classified as high-risk (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68) and low-risk (6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, and 54) types consistent with the generation of squamous cell carcinomas in the uterine cervix 2 . the papillomavirus double-stranded circular dna genome encodes roughly eight open-reading frames (orfs), which is responsible for viral replication, maintenance, and cell transformation. these gene products have been classified into six nonstructural regulatory proteins (e1-e6) and two structural capsid proteins (l1 and l2) 3 . nowadays, the virus-like particles (vlps) based on l1 proteins have been considered as the best candidate for vaccine development against hpv infections. two commercial hpv vaccines are both prophylactic. gardasil which protects against hpv genotypes 6, 11, 16 and 18, and cervarix which protects against hpv genotypes 16 and 18; both of them prevent cervical cancer with almost 100% efficacy 4 . these hpv vlp vaccines confer protection against limited genotypes 5 . although a variable level of cross-protection has also been observed against phylogenetically related hpv genotypes 6 , major impediments such as economic barriers especially gaps in financing obstructed the optimal delivery of vaccines in developing countries. this might be approached via locally produced generic vaccines. storage and transportation, the so-called cold chain, is another hindrance, which should be mitigated through   lyophilization or protectants, and also it should be noted that many recombinant vaccines rely on multiple immunizations; however, promising results could be obtained with a single dose and certainly 2-dose regimens 7 .recently, a possible approach to broader cross-type protective immunity at a lower cost is to consider l2-based vaccination compared to l1 vlp immunization 8 . indeed, the current hpv l2 vaccines improved a type-specific protection. recent studies showed that some regions in the n-terminus of l2 can neutralize antibodies generated during various types of hpv infections 9 . to overcome the intrinsically low immunogenicity of the recombinant l2 protein, its potency could be increased by various formulations such as the multivalent l2 epitopes (peptide vaccine) 10-12 , fusion with l1 and other immunogenic proteins 13-15 and multiepitope dna-based vaccines 16, 17 .as a major field of science, bioinformatics has brought together the concepts of in silico analyses of biological queries, mathematics and statistics 18 . immunoinformatics tools could help researchers to screen multiple hpv genome and predict high immunogenic epitopes, which provide a t or b cell response against hpv infection    . in this study, the combination of in silico/in vivo approaches was used to evaluate l1 and l2 proteins of high-risk hpv types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68), and to design a pan genotype l1 and l2 constructs for development of dna-based vaccines.protein conservancy analysis. to select conserved epitopes between hpv subtypes, l1 and l2 protein sequences were aligned using muscle algorithms. based on the degree of the conservancy, five regions of l1 proteins (8-22, 95-132, 307-342, 398-425 and 449-473) and four regions of l2 proteins (11-40, 54-76, 96-120, 278-305) were selected for further immune-bioinformatics analysis such as b-and t-cell epitope prediction. among them, region 449-473 of hpv-16 l1 protein and region 54-76 of hpv-16 l2 protein had the highest score of conservancy between all high-risk hpv types. in addition, based on sequence variability of conserved regions, the l1 and l2 proteins from two main types of hpv (16 and 18) were selected as a reference for calculation of conservancy by iedb epitope conservancy analysis tool (tables 1 and 2 ).prediction of linear b-cell epitopes. b-cell epitopes are recognized by b-cell receptors or antibodies in their native structure. continuous b-cell epitope prediction is very similar to t-cell epitope prediction, which has mainly been based on the amino acid properties such as hydrophobicity, exposed surface area, protein regions sequence and degree of conservancy 8-22 (type 16) eatvylppvpvskvv scientific reports | (2019) 9:15225 |  transport/proteasomal cleavage. the generation of antigenic peptides and their transport across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum for assembly with mhc class i molecules are essential steps in antigen presentation to cytotoxic t lymphocytes. thus, investigating the proteasomal cleavage, tap transport and affinity prediction of binding is essential in mhc-1 presentation pathway. the netctl2.1 server was used to predict tap transport efficiency and proteasomal cleavage scores (table 8). between all epitopes, l1 12-21 (ylppvpvskv-type 16 and ylpppsvarv-type 18), l1 460-470 (dqfplgrkfll-type 16), l1 461-471 (dqyplgrkflv-type 18), l2 11-20 (krasatqlyk-type 16 and krasvtdlyk-type 18), l2 293-303 (dpdfldivalhr-type 16) and l2 273-284 (dsdfmdiirlhr-type 18) epitopes had the highest epitope identification scores. scientific reports | (2019) 9:15225 |","Ali Namvar, Azam Bolhassani, Gholamreza Javadi, Zahra Noormohammadi"

9821,An uncharacterized FMAG_01619 protein from Fusobacterium mortiferum ATCC 9817 demonstrates that some bacterial macrodomains can also act as poly- ADp-ribosylhydrolases,"abstractmacrodomains constitute a conserved fold widely distributed that is not only able to bind adp-ribose in its free and protein-linked forms but also can catalyse the hydrolysis of the latter. they are involved in the regulation of important cellular processes, such as signalling, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, and in host-virus response, and for this, they are considered as promising therapeutic targets to slow tumour progression and viral pathogenesis. although extensive work has been carried out with them, including their classification into six distinct phylogenetically clades, little is known on bacterial macrodomains, especially if these latter are able to remove poly(adp-ribose) polymer (par) from parylated proteins, activity that only has been confirmed in human targ1 (c6orf130) protein. to extend this limited knowledge, we demonstrate, after a comprehensive bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis, that fusobacterium mortiferum atcc 9817 targ1 (fmtarg1) is the first bacterial macrodomain shown to have high catalytic efficiency towards o-acyl-adp-ribose, even more than htarg1, and towards mono-and poly(adpribosyl)ated proteins. surprisingly, fmtarg1 gene is also inserted into a unique operonic context, only shared by the distantly related fusobacterium perfoetens atcc 29250 macrodomain, which include an immunity protein 51 domain, typical of bacterial polymorphic toxin systems.macrodomains constitute a unique conserved 130-190 amino acids three-layered α/β/α sandwich fold widely distributed throughout the phylogenetic scale. they exert a regulatory influence on cellular signalling, transcription, dna repair, genomic stability, telomere dynamics, necrosis and apoptosis, in addition to cell differentiation and proliferation 1 . they are also involved in different aspects of posttranslational protein modification of the adp-ribosylation signalling pathway, including reading, erasing, and modulating, in combination with two other important nad + -using protein families, poly(adp-ribose) polymerases (parps) and sirtuins 2-9 .to carry out such a plethora of functions, macrodomains not only bind adp-ribose (adpr) in its free and protein-linked forms, but also related ligands, such as o-acyl-adp-ribose (oaadpr), and even unconnected ones, such as poly(a) or g-quadruplex sequences 1 . in addition, they could also catalyse the hydrolysis of the 2′,1′′-o-glycosidic ribose-ribose bond in poly(adp-ribose)-modified proteins (also called de-parylation), the protein-mono-adp-ribose (mar) ester bond (de-marylation), or the acyl-adpr ester (deacylation) 10-14 .macrodomains have been phylogenetically subdivided into six distinct clades 1,14 . macrod-type clade is the most studied and comprises several distinct proteins ranging from mono-(adp-ribosyl) hydrolases and oaadpr deacetylases, such as human macrod1 and macrod2 15 , oceanobacillus iheyensis macrod (oimacrod) 14 and e. coli ymdb 16 , to poly(a) binding modules, such as gdap2, a highly conserved protein found from plants to humans with a lipid-binding sec14 domain at the c terminus 17 . another class characterized by strong binding to adp-ribosylated proteins without catalytic activity is the macroh2a-type clade, which include the epigenetic tumour suppressor macroh2a 18,19 , and the macrodomains from multidomain human parp9, parp14, and parp15, which are involved in the regulation of cell migration associated with lymphoma (parp9 and parp14) 20 , in tumour suppression (parp15) 21 and in the host-virus response (parp14 and parp15) 22 . macrodomain-containing proteins from coronaviridae, togaviridae, and hepeviridae virus families have also been identified as a separate clade 23,24 , as a part of the multidomain nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), which is involved in host protein recruitment and viral replication 25 . these macrodomains, also known as x domain or mac1, are present in several (+)ssrna viruses (e.g. hepatitis e virus, sars coronavirus, human coronavirus hcov 229e, venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and chikungunya virus) and possess broad hydrolase activity towards mono-adp-ribosylated proteins (parp15, parp14 and parp10) 26 , but only weak activity towards par automodified parp1 27 and adp-ribose-1′′-phosphate 28-30 . in addition, the nsp3 proteins of sars coronavirus (sars-cov) and other β-coronaviruses (mers-cov, btvs-betacov/sc2013) contain a non-conserved region that follows the x domain (or mac 1) with two additional macrodomains, mac2 and mac3, formerly known as sud-n and sud-m 25 , respectively. mac2 and mac3 do not bind or hydrolyse adp-ribose, but do bind g quadruplexes 24,31 . however, while mac2 has been seen to be dispensable for the sars-cov replication/transcription complex, mac3 is essential for such processes, even though it is not conserved in all the coronaviruses 31 . thus, viral macrodomains seem to be critical for viral pathogenesis and evasion of the host immune response, making them an important target for top-rated pathogens that are in need for vaccine development, such as chikungunya virus 27 .poly(adp-ribose) glycohydrolases (pargs) form another diverged clade, which were recognized as macrodomains only after their seven-stranded mixed β-sheet sandwiched by a five α-helices structure with the parg-specific gggx (6-8) qee catalytic motif within loop 1 was determined both in bacteria and human 32,33 . these enzymes release oligo-or poly(adpr) fragments from parylated proteins, being predominantly exoglycohydrolases with only minor contributions to debranching par polymers 34 . on the other hand, the macro-2 type clade groups important and ubiquitous cellular processing macrodomain enzymes involved in the trna splicing pathway, which catalyses the conversion of adp-ribose-1′′-phosphate (appr-1′′-p) to adp-ribose 35 , with no de-marylating activity 36 . their only studied representative is the hypothetical saccharomyces cerevisiae atcc 204508/s288c ymr087w protein (uniprot code ymx7_yeast) 35 . by contrast, the ybr022w macrodomain protein of the same yeast strain (now named poa1) not only converts appr-1′′-p to adp-ribose, being responsible for ∼90% of appr1p processing activity in yeast extracts, but also produces de-marylation 37 . these differences in activity could be related to the fact that poa1 belongs to a different macrodomain clade, the alc1 clade, thus named for the presence in it of the chromatin remodeler alc1 (amplified in liver cancer 1) protein 38 , and whose macrodomain binds to sites of dna damage by sensing parp1-generated par 39 . belonging to the same clade is the streptomyces coelicolor sco6735 macrodomain protein, which hydrolyses glutamate-linked protein mono-adp-ribosylation, and whose depletion significantly increases the production of the antibiotic actinorhodin in s. coelicolor 40 . interestingly, a unique class of macrodomains with dna adp-ribosyl glycohydrolase activity, such as mycobacterium tuberculosis and thermus aquaticus darg proteins, could also be included in this clade. these last proteins reverse the thymidine base-specific adp-ribosylation caused by the corresponding dart toxins, a new class of dna adp-ribosyl transferases 41 . these darg proteins are structurally most similar to metazoan targ1 (terminal adpr protein glycohydrolase1, also known as oard1 or c6orf130) proteins, but with an active site mostly positively charged to facilitate the binding of their negatively charged ssdna substrate 41 . of note, full-length darg seems to inhibit dart through a protein-protein interaction, providing another layer of dart regulation, in addition to its macrodomain hydrolytic activity 41 . this mechanism of dart-darg interaction has some parallelism with that recently described for the bifunctional immunity protein tri1, an adp-ribosyl hydrolase, which protects the essential bacterial tubulin-like protein ftsz against the adp-ribosylating toxin tre1 42 .interestingly, the above-described human targ1 (htarg1) is the only known macrodomain able to hydrolyse oaadpr, marylated proteins 10 , and the ribose-acceptor bond of par-modified parp1, removing the entire par chain en bloc 12 . its catalytic lysine residue forms a covalent intermediate with the ribose ring through an amadori rearrangement mechanism, followed by aspartic acid-mediated hydrolysis 12 . surprisingly, although this special class of macrodomain containing all three activities has been described in some bacteria as a possible alternative mechanism for reversing protein adp-ribosylation 2 , they have not previously been characterized.the present work presents a comprehensive bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis of putative targ1 proteins in bacterial organisms to better understand their distribution. we have focused our research on fusobacterium mortiferum atcc 9817 targ1 because of its sequence identity with human targ1, being the first protein ever characterised from this microorganism. interestingly, we show that such an enzyme was the first bacterial macrodomain able to remove the par polymer, confirming this unique feature of targ1-type macrodomains compared with macrod-type macrodomains. in addition, the operonic structure in which fmtarg1 gene is inserted is also unique in nature and is only shared with the distantly related microorganism f. perfoetens atcc 29250.","Antonio Ginés García-Saura, Rubén Zapata-Pérez, José Francisco Hidalgo, Juana Cabanes, Fernando Gil-Ortiz, &amp; Álvaro Sánchez-Ferrer"

12460,Dynamic Innate Immune Responses of Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome- Associated Coronavirus Infection,"abstracthuman lung epithelial cells are likely among the first targets to encounter invading severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus (sars-cov). not only can these cells support the growth of sars-cov infection, but they are also capable of secreting inflammatory cytokines to initiate and, eventually, aggravate host innate inflammatory responses, causing detrimental immune-mediated pathology within the lungs. thus, a comprehensive evaluation of the complex epithelial signaling to sars-cov is crucial for paving the way to better understand sars pathogenesis. based on microarraybased functional genomics, we report here the global gene response of 2b4 cells, a cloned bronchial epithelial cell line derived from calu-3 cells. specifically, we found a temporal and spatial activation of nuclear factor (nf)kb, activator protein (ap)-1, and interferon regulatory factor (irf)-3/7 in infected 2b4 cells at 12-, 24-, and 48-hrs post infection (p.i.), resulting in the activation of many antiviral genes, including interferon (ifn)-b, -ls, inflammatory mediators, and many ifn-stimulated genes (isgs). we also showed, for the first time, that ifn-b and ifn-ls were capable of exerting previously unrecognized, non-redundant, and complementary abilities to limit sars-cov replication, even though their expression could not be detected in infected 2b4 bronchial epithelial cells until 48 hrs p.i. collectively, our results highlight the mechanics of the sequential events of antiviral signaling pathway/s triggered by sars-cov in bronchial epithelial cells and identify novel cellular targets for future studies, aiming at advancing strategies against sars. citation: yoshikawa t, hill te, yoshikawa n, popov vl, galindo cl, et al.

8127,Citation: Expression Pattern Analysis of Antiviral Genes and Inflammatory Cytokines in PEDV-Infected Porcine Intestinal Epithelial Cells,"abstractporcine diarrhea disease in newborn and suckling piglets due to infection with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (pedv) is a leading cause of economic loss in the pig industry globally. in this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the host innate immune response to pedv infection. the expression dynamics of antiviral genes (e.g., rig-1, pkr, oas1, mx1, and mx2) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., ifn-α, in porcine small intestinal epithelial (ipec-j2) cells were analyzed following pedv stimulation. the results showed that the expression of antiviral genes (e.g., pkr, oas1, and mx2) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., ifn-α and tnf-α) were significantly reduced within 0-4 h post-infection (p < 0.05). however, all antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines were up-regulated from 12 to 24 h (p < 0.05), and cytopathic changes were observed during this time. the expression of rig-1, pkr, oas1, mx1, and mx2 were significantly and positively correlated to each other during the entire infection (p < 0.01). the results suggested that the rig-1, pkr, oas1, mx1, and mx2 genes may play an important role in pedv infection in piglets. initially, pedv displayed cellular invasion by inhibiting ifn-α transcription and interfering with the antiviral function of pkr, oas1, and mx2, ultimately induced an intense inflammatory response. the relationship between antiviral genes and inflammatory cytokines with pedv infection at the cellular level provides a reference for studying the mechanism of resistance to pedv infection in piglets.","Ryan Arsenault, Faten Abdelaal Okda, Wang S , Wu J , Wang F , Wang H , Wu Z , Wu S , Bao , Shiqin Wang, Jiayun Wu, † , Fang Wang, Haifei Wang, Zhengchang Wu, Shenglong Wu, Wenbin Bao"
4416,Manipulation of Intestinal Antiviral Innate Immunity and Immune Evasion Strategies of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus,"abstractporcine epidemic diarrhea virus (pedv) infection causes watery diarrhea, dehydration, and high mortality in neonatal pigs, due to its clinical pathogenesis of the intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction. e host's innate immune system is the first line of defence upon virus invasion of the small intestinal epithelial cells. in turn, the virus has evolved to modulate the host's innate immunity during infection, resulting in pathogen virulence, survival, and the establishment of successful infection. in this review, we gather current knowledge concerning the interplay between pedv and components of host innate immunity, focusing on the role of cytokines and interferons in intestinal antiviral innate immunity, and the mechanisms underlying the immune evasion strategies of pedv invasion. finally, we provide some perspectives on the potential prevention and treatment for pedv infection.as a swine enteric coronavirus, pedv is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded rna (ssrna) virus  . e pedv genome of 28.5 kb is polycistronic and consists of orf1a, orf1b, orf3, spike protein, envelope protein, membrane protein, and nucleocapsid protein  . pedv","Jian Du, Junqiu Luo, Jie Yu, Xiangbing Mao, Yuheng Luo, Ping Zheng, Jun He, Bing Yu, Daiwen Chen"

10925,Effects of Adjuvants on the Immunogenicity and Efficacy of a Zika Virus Envelope Domain III Subunit Vaccine,"abstractzika virus (zikv), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, has attracted global attention due to its close association with congenital zika syndrome and neurological diseases, and transmission through additional routes, such as sexual contact. currently there are no vaccines approved for zikv, and thus, there is an urgent need to develop an effective and safe zikv vaccine. domain iii (diii) of the zikv envelope (e) protein is an important vaccine target, and a vaccine developed using a mutant diii of e (ediii) protein protects adult and pregnant mice, and unborn offspring, against zikv infection. here, we have used immunocompetent balb/c mice treated with anti-interferon-α/β receptor 1 (ifnar1) antibodies to investigate whether three adjuvants (aluminum (alum), monophosphoryl lipid a (mpl), and mf59), either alone or in combination, could improve the efficacy of this ediii subunit vaccine. our data show that, although vaccine formulated with a single adjuvant induced a specific antibody and cellular immune response, and reduced viral load in mice challenged with zikv, the combination of alum and mpl adjuvants led to a more robust and balanced immune response, stronger neutralizing activity against three recent zikv human strains, and greater protection against a high-dose zikv challenge. particularly, the combination of alum with mpl significantly reduced viral titers and viral rna copy numbers in sera and tissues, including the male reproductive organs. overall, this study has identified the combination of alum and mpl as the most effective adjuvant for zikv ediii subunit vaccines, and it has important implications for subunit vaccines against other enveloped viruses, including non-zikv flaviviruses.vaccines 2019, 7, 161 2 of 16 with microcephaly, fetal demise, and other congenital disorders    . thus, zikv has emerged as a global health threat and there is an urgent requirement for an effective vaccine to combat zikv-associated diseases.the zikv genome encodes a single polyprotein, which is processed into three structural proteins (capsid (c), precursor of membrane/membrane (prm/m), and envelope (e)) and seven non-structural proteins (ns1, ns2a, ns2b, ns3, ns4a, ns4b, and ns5)    . the e protein has important roles in infection and pathogenesis, is involved in virus binding to target cells and membrane fusion, and also serves as an important vaccine target  8] . the e protein is a transmembrane protein and consists of three domains termed i, ii, and iii (di-diii), a fusion loop (fl), and a stalk region (s)  . the di-dii region of zikv e protein is a target for cross-reactive antibodies with other flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (denv) and west nile virus (wnv), whereas the diii domain induces zikv-specific antibodies    , and therefore, is a key target for zikv vaccine development. zikv vaccine candidates under development include inactivated virus, live attenuated virus, dna, mrna, viral vectors, virus-like particles (vlps), and viral proteins (or subunit vaccines)     . although many have advanced clinical trials and been tested for immunogenicity and/or levels of protection    , none are approved for use in humans. thus, continuous efforts are required to develop safe and efficacious zikv vaccines.subunit vaccines do not contain live virus or normally elicit adverse side effects and are safe for use in humans including pregnant women and unborn offspring  21] . however, subunit vaccines often suffer from low immunogenicity, although this may be improved by adjuvants. adjuvants are important components of vaccines as they enhance the immunogenicity of vaccine antigens by boosting the quality and duration of the humoral and/or cellular immune response. aluminum salts (alum) are approved for use as adjuvants for human vaccines in the u.s. they are also key components of vaccines for a number of viruses including hepatitis a virus (hav), hepatitis b virus (hbv), and human papilloma virus (hpv)  23] . the alum adjuvants most commonly used in licensed vaccines are alum hydroxide and alum phosphate  . monophosphoryl lipid a (mpl), a non-toxic derivative of lipopolysaccharide (lps) and a toll-like receptor (tlr) agonist, can also be used as an adjuvant for human vaccines  . in addition, as04 (a combination of alum and mpl) is used in vaccines for hbv and hpv , while mf59 (an oil-in-water emulsion) has been approved for use with conjugated vaccines for a number of viruses, including influenza virus, herpes simplex virus (hsv), and human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)  23] .previously, we have shown that a zikv e protein diii-based subunit vaccine, fused with the fc region of human igg, induced specific neutralizing antibodies against divergent zikv strains  . furthermore, masking a non-neutralizing epitope (centered on residue 375) of this protein by a glycan probe (diii of e (ediii)) enhanced the neutralizing antibody response, and increased protection of adult and pregnant mice against zikv challenge without any impact on fetal development  . here, using this ediii-based subunit vaccine, we compared the adjuvanticity of mf59, alum, mpl, or alum + mpl combination (refer to as04), in a hope to identify an

8246,Functional Analysis of Rift Valley Fever Virus NSs Encoding a Partial Truncation,"abstractrift valley fever virus (rvfv), belongs to genus phlebovirus of the family bunyaviridae, causes high rates of abortion and fetal malformation in infected ruminants as well as causing neurological disorders, blindness, or lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans. rvfv is classified as a category a priority pathogen and a select agent in the u.s., and currently there are no therapeutics available for rvf patients. nss protein, a major virulence factor of rvfv, inhibits host transcription including interferon (ifn)-b mrna synthesis and promotes degradation of dsrna-dependent protein kinase (pkr). nss self-associates at the c-terminus 17 aa., while nss at aa.210-230 binds to sin3a-associated protein (sap30) to inhibit the activation of ifn-b promoter. thus, we hypothesize that nss function(s) can be abolished by truncation of specific domains, and co-expression of nonfunctional nss with intact nss will result in the attenuation of nss function by dominant-negative effect. unexpectedly, we found that rvfv nss truncated at aa. 6-30, 31-55, 56-80, 81-105, 106-130, 131-155, 156-180, 181-205, 206-230, 231-248 or 249-265 lack functions of ifn-b mrna synthesis inhibition and degradation of pkr. truncated nss were less stable in infected cells, while nuclear localization was inhibited in nss lacking either of aa. 81-105, 106-130, 131-155, 156-180, 181-205, 206-230 or 231-248. furthermore, none of truncated nss had exhibited significant dominantnegative functions for nss-mediated ifn-b suppression or pkr degradation upon co-expression in cells infected with rvfv. we also found that any of truncated nss except for intact nss does not interact with rvfv nss even in the presence of intact c-terminus self-association domain. our results suggest that conformational integrity of nss is important for the stability, cellular localization and biological functions of rvfv nss, and the co-expression of truncated nss does not exhibit dominant-negative phenotype.","J A Head, B Kalveram, T Ikegami"
12212,Prion-like Domains in Eukaryotic Viruses OPEN,"abstractprions are proteins that can self-propagate, leading to the misfolding of proteins. in addition to the previously demonstrated pathogenic roles of prions during the development of different mammalian diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, they have recently been shown to represent an important functional component in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and bacteriophages, confirming the previously unexplored important regulatory and functional roles. however, an indepth analysis of these domains in eukaryotic viruses has not been performed. here, we examined the presence of prion-like proteins in eukaryotic viruses that play a primary role in different ecosystems and that are associated with emerging diseases in humans. we identified relevant functional associations in different viral processes and regularities in their presence at different taxonomic levels. using the prion-like amino-acid composition computational algorithm, we detected 2679 unique putative prionlike domains within 2,742,160 publicly available viral protein sequences. our findings indicate that viral prion-like proteins can be found in different viruses of insects, plants, mammals, and humans. the analysis performed here demonstrated common patterns in the distribution of prion-like domains across viral orders and families, and revealed probable functional associations with different steps of viral replication and interaction with host cells. these data allow the identification of the viral prion-like proteins as potential novel regulators of viral infections.recently, prions and their infectious forms have attracted a lot of research attention 1,2 . the infectious prion forms (prpsc) represent the misfolded normal proteins (prpc) and were shown to be infectious, since then can self-propagate and interact with the endogenous prpc, catalyzing their conversion into pathological prpsc 3-7 . previously they had been primarily known as the inducers of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, however, today they have been shown to be involved in the development of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases    .recently, the abnormal conformation of self-propagating prpscs was found to be associated with the formation of the toxic, misfolded, insoluble, and highly-ordered fibrillar cross-β aggregates of β-amyloid, tau, and tdp-43 proteins in alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 11-14 . the follow-up studies demonstrated that the pathological protein conversion and the deposition of the insoluble protein aggregates are associated with the development of other diseases, including parkinson's, huntington, fatal familial insomnia, ataxias, diabetes, and others 9,15,16 . however, protein misfolding was shown to play important physiological roles as well in eukaryotes and prokaryotes 17-21 . self-perpetuating properties of prions are important for the formation of bacterial and fungal biofilms, bacterial bacteriocin functioning, molecular transport and secretion, and the preservation of long-term memory in yeasts 22-25 . moreover, prions were recently shown to participate in the communication between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, resulting in the alterations in caenorhabditis elegans amyloid formation following its colonization with amyloid-producing escherichia coli 26 .although the molecular mechanisms underlying de novo prion formation remains elusive, the aggregation of prps is an amino-acid sequence-dependent process. most prions contain specific domains enriched in asparagine (q) and glutamine (n), which, together with the average residue hydrophobicity and net sequence charge, allowed the development of algorithms for the identification of candidate prionogenic domains (prds) based on the hidden markov model (hmm) 20,27-30 .the hmm is currently used in many bioinformatic approaches for the statistical representation of prion domains, which allow, using the probabilistic sequence model of maximum likelihood estimation, to evaluate the compositional similarity of proteins and prions. one of these approaches is prion-like amino acid composition (plaac) analysis, which allows the evaluation of proteins containing prds, defined as domains with the compositional similarity to yeast prion domains, based on amino-acid interactions 27,31 .published: xx xx xxxx open  2 scientific reports | (2018) 8:8931 | ratio (llr) indicates the possibility that the analyzed protein is a prion. using plaac algorithms, prds defined as domains shown to contain at least a domain compositionally similar to yeast prions, have recently been investigated in different eukaryotic and prokaryotic species, confirming their important regulatory and functional roles 20,32-34 . there are other algorithms, such as papa and prionw, using an experimentally derived prion propensity score combined with explicit consideration of the intrinsic disorder, that help to predict prion domains bioinformatically     . recently, we investigated the prds in phagobiota and determined that these domains can be found in bacterial and archaeal virus families, which increased our understanding of their possible interplay with microbiota and implication for human health 39 .similar to the bacterial viruses, eukaryotic viruses are found in nearly all ecosystems and they infect different types of organisms, including animals, insects, protists, and plants, but their life cycle is similar in different organisms, comprising the attachment, entry, biosynthesis of viral nucleic acids and proteins, maturation, and release of progeny 40 . the nature of the viral replication cycle leads to their pathogenicity, although certain viral species induce persistent infections 41 . viruses are efficiently disseminated by horizontal and vertical transmission, and they are the causative agents of many devastating diseases, such as flu and some cancers 42, 43 . however, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the pathological processes have not be completely elucidated yet 14, 44 .moreover, despite previous efforts, the presence of prds in eukaryotic viruses has not been described very well and the prds have been identified in only several viral families 19, 34 . therefore, the prds distribution in different viral families and species and their functionalities have not been determined to date.here, we performed a detailed study of the putative prion domains in all known eukaryotic viruses. using an hmm algorithm, we retrieved all available eukaryotic viral protein sequences from the uniprot kb database 44 . to the best of our knowledge, this is the most extensive effort aimed at the identification of candidate prd sequences among eukaryotic viruses. furthermore, we analyzed the regularities in the distribution of prds in different viral taxes, correlation of this distribution with viral structure, viral hosts, and protein functions. the prds were identified using different algorithms, including gene ontology (go) 45 . our results may contribute to the better understanding of the host-viral interactions and the relationship between viral prions and pathogenicity.protein sequences. to identify the prds present in viral proteomes, protein sequences were obtained from the uniprot knowledgebase (swiss-prot and trembl). protein functions were predicted using the go terms and manually curated using the information from the uniprot database, the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi), and the literature data 46 .","George Tetz, Victor Tetz"
5899,Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis of Immune-Related Gene Expression in Duck Embryo Fibroblasts Following Duck Tembusu Virus Infection,"abstractduck is a major waterfowl species in china, providing high-economic benefit with a population of up to 20-30 billion per year. ducks are commonly affected by severe diseases, including egg-drop syndrome caused by duck tembusu virus (dtmuv). the immune mechanisms against dtmuv invasion and infection remain poorly understood. in this study, duck embryo fibroblasts (defs) were infected with dtmuv and harvested at 12 and 24 h post-infection (hpi), and their genomes were sequenced. in total, 911 (764 upregulated and 147 downregulated genes) and 3008 (1791 upregulated and 1217 downregulated) differentially expressed genes (degs) were identified at 12 and 24 hpi, respectively. kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes enrichment analysis revealed that degs were considerably enriched in immune-relevant pathways, including toll-like receptor signaling pathway, cytosolic dna-sensing pathway, rig-i-like receptor signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, nod-like receptor signaling pathway, and hematopoietic cell lineage at both time points. the key degs in immune system included those of the cytokines (ifn α2, il-6, il-8l, il-12b, ccr7, ccl19, and ccl20), transcription factors or signaling molecules (irf7, nf-κb, stat1, tmem173, and tnfaip3), pattern recognition receptors (rig-i and mda5), and antigen-presenting proteins (cd44 and cd70). this suggests dtmuv infection induces strong proinflammatory/antiviral effects with enormous production of cytokines. however, these cytokines could not protect defs against viral attack. our data revealed valuable transcriptional information regarding dtmuv-infected defs, thereby broadening our understanding of the immune response against dtmuv infection; this information might contribute in developing strategies for controlling the prevalence of dtmuv infection.","Guanliu Yu, Yun Lin, Yi Tang, Youxiang Diao"

9138,The Proteolytic Activation of (H3N2) Influenza A Virus Hemagglutinin Is Facilitated by Different Type II Transmembrane Serine Proteases,"abstractin humans and mice, members of the type ii transmembrane protease family (ttsp), e.g., tmprss2, tmprss4, and tmprss11d (hat), have been shown to cleave influenza virus ha for viral activation and infectivity in vitro. recently, we reported that inactivation of a single ha-activating protease gene, tmprss2, in knockout mice inhibits the spread of h1n1 influenza viruses. however, after infection of tmprss2 knockout mice with an h3n2 influenza virus, only a slight increase in survival was observed, and mice still lost body weight. in this study, we investigated an additional trypsin-like protease, tmprss4. both tmprss2 and tmprss4 are expressed in the same cell types of the mouse lung. deletion of tmprss4 alone in knockout mice does not protect them from body weight loss and death upon infection with h3n2 influenza virus. in contrast, tmprss2 ؊/؊ tmprss4 ؊/؊ double-knockout mice showed a remarkably reduced virus spread and lung pathology, in addition to reduced body weight loss and mortality. thus, our results identified tmprss4 as a second host cell protease that, in addition to tmprss2, is able to activate the ha of h3n2 influenza virus in vivo.influenza epidemics and recurring pandemics are responsible for significant global morbidity and mortality. due to high variability of the virus genome, resistance to available antiviral drugs is frequently observed, and new targets for treatment of influenza are needed. host cell factors essential for processing of the virus hemagglutinin represent very suitable drug targets because the virus is dependent on these host factors for replication. we reported previously that tmprss2-deficient mice are protected against h1n1 virus infections, but only marginal protection against h3n2 virus infections was observed. here we show that deletion of two host protease genes, tmprss2 and tmprss4, strongly reduced viral spread as well as lung pathology and resulted in increased survival after h3n2 virus infection. thus, tmprss4 represents another host cell factor that is involved in cleavage activation of h3n2 influenza viruses in vivo.citation kühn n, bergmann s, kösterke n, lambertz rlo, keppner a, van den brand jma, pöhlmann s, weiß s, hummler e, hatesuer b, schughart k. 2016. the proteolytic activation of (h3n2) influenza a virus hemagglutinin is facilitated by different type ii transmembrane serine proteases. j virol 90:4298 -4307.","Nora Kühn, Silke Bergmann, Nadine Kösterke, Ruth L O Lambertz, Anna Keppner, Judith M A Van Den Brand, Stefan Pöhlmann, Siegfried Weiß, Edith Hummler, Bastian Hatesuer, Klaus Schughart"
1498,Efficient Replication of the Novel Human Betacoronavirus EMC on Primary Human Epithelium Highlights Its Zoonotic Potential,"abstractthe recent emergence of a novel human coronavirus (hcov-emc) in the middle east raised considerable concerns, as it is associated with severe acute pneumonia, renal failure, and fatal outcome and thus resembles the clinical presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) observed in 2002 and 2003. like sars-cov, hcov-emc is of zoonotic origin and closely related to bat coronaviruses. the human airway epithelium (hae) represents the entry point and primary target tissue for respiratory viruses and is highly relevant for assessing the zoonotic potential of emerging respiratory viruses, such as hcov-emc. here, we show that pseudostratified hae cultures derived from different donors are highly permissive to hcov-emc infection, and by using reverse transcription (rt)-pcr and rnaseq data, we experimentally determined the identity of sevenhcov-emc subgenomic mrnas. although the hae cells were readily responsive to type i and type iii interferon (ifn), we observed neither a pronounced inflammatory cytokine nor any detectable ifn responses following hcov-emc, sars-cov, or hcov-229e infection, suggesting that innate immune evasion mechanisms and putative ifn antagonists of hcov-emc are operational in the new host. importantly, however, we demonstrate that both type i and type iii ifn can efficiently reduce hcov-emc replication in hae cultures, providing a possible treatment option in cases of suspected hcov-emc infection.hcov-emc infection. an important first barrier against invading respiratory pathogens is the epithelium, representing the entry point and primary target tissue of respiratory viruses. we show that human bronchial epithelia are highly susceptible to hcov-emc infection. furthermore, hcov-emc, like other coronaviruses, evades innate immune recognition, reflected by the lack of interferon and minimal inflammatory cytokine expression following infection. importantly, type i and type iii interferon treatment can efficiently reduce hcov-emc replication in the human airway epithelium, providing a possible avenue for treatment of emerging virus infections.citation kindler e, jónsdóttir hr, muth d, hamming oj, hartmann r, rodriguez r, geffers r, fouchier ram, drosten c, müller ma, dijkman r, thiel v. 2013. efficient replication of the novel human betacoronavirus emc on primary human epithelium highlights its zoonotic potential. mbio 4(1):e00611-12.","Eveline Kindler, Hulda R Jónsdóttir, Doreen Muth, Ole J Hamming, Rune Hartmann, Regulo Rodriguez, Robert Geffers, Ron A M Fouchier, Christian Drosten, Marcel A Müller, Ronald Dijkman, Volker Thiel, E K , H R J , D M , Michael Buchmeier"

9857,Dynamics of a Cytokine Storm,"abstractsix volunteers experienced severe inflammatory response during the phase i clinical trial of a monoclonal antibody that was designed to stimulate a regulatory t cell response. soon after the trial began, each volunteer experienced a ''cytokine storm'', a dramatic increase in cytokine concentrations. the monoclonal antibody, tgn1412, raised serum concentrations of both pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines to very hich values during the first day, while lymphocyte and monocyte concentrations plummeted. because the subjects were healthy and had no prior indications of immune deficiency, this event provided an unusual opportunity to study the dynamic interactions of cytokines and other measured parameters. here, the response histories of nine cytokines have been modeled by a set of linear ordinary differential equations. a general search procedure identifies parameters of the model, whose response fits the data well during the five-day measurement period. the eighteenth-order model reveals plausible cause-and-effect relationships among the cytokines, showing how each cytokine induces or inhibits other cytokines. it suggests that perturbations in il2, il8, and il10 have the most significant inductive effect, while ifn-c and il12 have the greatest inhibiting effect on other cytokine concentrations. although tnf-a is a major pro-inflammatory factor, ifn-c and three other cytokines have faster initial and median response to tgn1412 infusion. principal-component analysis of the data reveals three clusters of similar cytokine responses: tnf-a, il1, il10], il2, il4, il8, and il12], and il6]. il1, il6, il10, and tnf-a have the highest degree of variability in response to uncertain initial conditions, exogenous effects, and parameter estimates. this study illuminates details of a cytokine storm event, and it demonstrates the value of linear modeling for interpreting complex, coupled biological system dynamics from empirical data.citation: yiu hh, graham al, stengel rf (2012) dynamics of a cytokine storm. plos one 7(10): e45027.","Hong Hao,  Yiu, Andrea L Graham, Robert F Stengel"

11199,Ocular Manifestations of Emerging Flaviviruses and the Blood-Retinal Barrier,"abstractdespite flaviviruses remaining the leading cause of systemic human infections worldwide, ocular manifestations of these mosquito-transmitted viruses are considered relatively uncommon in part due to under-reporting. however, recent outbreaks of zika virus (zikv) implicated in causing multiple ocular abnormalities, such as conjunctivitis, retinal hemorrhages, chorioretinal atrophy, posterior uveitis, optic neuritis, and maculopathies, has rejuvenated a significant interest in understanding the pathogenesis of flaviviruses, including zikv, in the eye. in this review, first, we summarize the current knowledge of the major flaviviruses (dengue, west nile, yellow fever, and japanese encephalitis) reported to cause ocular manifestations in humans with emphasis on recent zikv outbreaks. second, being an immune privilege organ, the eye is protected from systemic infections by the presence of blood-retinal barriers (brb). hence, we discuss how flaviviruses modulate retinal innate response and breach the protective brb to cause ocular or retinal pathology. finally, we describe recently identified infection signatures of zikv and discuss whether these system biology-predicted genes or signaling pathways (e.g., cellular metabolism) could contribute to the pathogenesis of ocular manifestations and assist in the development of ocular antiviral therapies against zikv and other flaviviruses.","Sneha Singh, Ashok Kumar"
5817,"Journal of Translational Medicine Interdependency of CEACAM-1, -3, -6, and -8 induced human neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells","abstractmembers of the carcinoembryonic antigen family (ceacams) are widely expressed, and, depending on the tissue, capable of regulating diverse functions including tumor promotion, tumor suppression, angiogenesis, and neutrophil activation. four members of this family, ceacam1, ceacam8, ceacam6, and ceacam3 (recognized by cd66a, cd66b, cd66c, and cd66d mabs, respectively), are expressed on human neutrophils. cd66a, cd66b, cd66c, and cd66d antibodies each increase neutrophil adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers. this increase in neutrophil adhesion caused by cd66 antibodies is blocked by cd18 mabs and is associated with upregulation of cd11/cd18 on the neutrophil surface. to examine potential interactions of ceacams in neutrophil signaling, the effects on neutrophil adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells of a set of cd66 mabs was tested following desensitization to stimulation by various combinations of these mabs. addition of a cd66 mab in the absence of calcium results in desensitization of neutrophils to stimulation by that cd66 mab. the current data show that desensitization of neutrophils to any two ceacams results in selective desensitization to those two ceacams, while the cells remain responsive to the other two neutrophil ceacams. in addition, cells desensitized to ceacam-3, -6, and -8 were still responsive to stimulation of ceacam1 by cd66a mabs. in contrast, desensitization of cells to ceacam1 and any two of the other ceacams left the cells unresponsive to all cd66 mabs. cells desensitized to any combination of ceacams remained responsive to the unrelated control protein cd63. thus, while there is significant independence of the four neutrophil ceacams in signaling, ceacam1 appears to play a unique role among the neutrophil ceacams. a model in which ceacams dimerize to form signaling complexes could accommodate the observations. similar interactions may occur in other cells expressing ceacams.","Keith M Skubitz, Amy Pn Skubitz"
4312,Influence of viral infection on the relationships between airway cytokines and lung function in asthmatic children the Community Action Against Asthma Steering Committee,"abstractbackground: few longitudinal studies examine inflammation and lung function in asthma. we sought to determine the cytokines that reduce airflow, and the influence of respiratory viral infections on these relationships. methods: children underwent home collections of nasal lavage during scheduled surveillance periods and selfreported respiratory illnesses. we studied 53 children for one year, analyzing 392 surveillance samples and 203 samples from 85 respiratory illnesses. generalized estimated equations were used to evaluate associations between nasal lavage biomarkers (7 mrnas, 10 proteins), lung function and viral infection. results: as anticipated, viral infection was associated with increased cytokines and reduced fvc and fev 1 . however, we found frequent and strong interactions between biomarkers and virus on lung function. for example, in the absence of viral infection, cxcl10 mrna, mda5 mrna, cxcl10, il-4, il-13, ccl4, ccl5, ccl20 and ccl24 were negatively associated with fvc. in contrast, during infection, the opposite relationship was frequently found, with il-4, il-13, ccl5, ccl20 and ccl24 levels associated with less severe reductions in both fvc and fev 1 . conclusions: in asthmatic children, airflow obstruction is driven by specific pro-inflammatory cytokines. in the absence of viral infection, higher cytokine levels are associated with decreasing lung function. however, with infection, there is a reversal in this relationship, with cytokine abundance associated with reduced lung function decline. while nasal samples may not reflect lower airway responses, these data suggest that some aspects of the inflammatory response may be protective against viral infection. this study may have ramifications for the treatment of viral-induced asthma exacerbations.","Toby C Lewis, Ediri E Metitiri, Graciela B Mentz, Xiaodan Ren, Ashley R Carpenter, Adam M Goldsmith, Kyra E Wicklund, Breanna N Eder, Adam T Comstock, Jeannette M Ricci, Sean R Brennan, Ginger L Washington, Kendall B Owens, Bhramar Mukherjee, Thomas G Robins, Stuart A Batterman, Marc B Hershenson"
5981,molecules Separation and Quantification of Four Main Chiral Glucosinolates in Radix Isatidis and Its Granules Using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography/Diode Array Detector Coupled with Circular Dichroism Detection,"abstractas chemical drugs, separation and quantification of the specific enantiomer from the chiral compounds in herbal medicines are becoming more important. to clarify the chemical characterization of chiral glucosinolates-the antiviral active ingredients of radix isatidis, an optimized efficient method of hplc-uv-cd was developed to simultaneously separate and quantify the four main chiral glucosinolates: progoitrin, epiprogoitrin, and r,s-goitrin. the first step was to determine progoitrin, epiprogoitrin, and r,s-goitrin using hplc-uv, and then determine the r-goitrin and s-goitrin by coupling with cd detection. subsequently, through the linear relations between anisotropy factor (g factor) and the percent optical purity of r-goitrin, the contents of r-goitrin and s-goitrin from the r,s-goitrin mixture were calculated separately. furthermore, the chemical composition features of the four chiral glucosinolates in 37 samples from crude drugs, decoction pieces, and granules of r. isatidis were conducted. the total content of the four glucosinolates was obviously higher in crude drugs, and the variance character of each glucosinolate contents was different. in summary, the accurate measurement method reported here allows for better control of the internal quality of r. isatidis and its granules and provides a powerful approach for the analysis of other chiral components in traditional chinese medicines.molecules 2018, 23, 1305 2 of 9 natural products of tcms are chiral. here, one isomer possesses a desired therapeutic effect, whereas its paired enantiomer could be inactive or even have undesirable effects  . for example, s-ibuprofen, the first chiral drugs of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug approved in 1994, was over a 100-fold more potent as an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase 1 enzyme than r-ibuprofen  . notably, 45 new drugs approved by the us food and drug administration in 2015 were single enantiomers, except for lesinurad  . for this reason, investigating the biological activities of specific enantiomers of chiral compounds in tcms is becoming more important. chiral analysis of the chemical constituents in tcms is therefore urgent and desired.radix isatidis, the dried roots of isatis indigotica fort. (fam. brassicaceae), have been used to remove heat and toxins, cool the blood, and clear the throat in oriental countries for thousands of years    . since 1985, it has been recorded in the chinese pharmacopoeia and recognized as an important traditional chinese herb for the prevention and treatment of cold and malignant infectious diseases, especially sars coronavirus and h1n1 influenza virus -10]. r. isatidis and its granules have been occupying a huge share of the international market in recent decades.the aqueous extract of r. isatidis and their chiral glucosinolates, such as epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, and r,s-goitrin, have attracted more attention due to their antiviral activity    . in our previous studies, the specific marker of r,s-goitrin has been used for quality evaluation of r. isatidis and its granules, which has been recorded in the chinese pharmacopoeia (2015 edition)  14, 15] . r-goitrin and s-goitrin were separately transferred from epiprogoitrin and progoitrin via the effect of myrosinase and considered to be the most noteworthy glucosinolate-biotransformed products  . the contents of degradation products might be influenced by the procedures of traditional processing and extraction in crude drugs, decoction pieces, and granules of r. isatidis  . furthermore, the pharmacological properties of r. isatidis is related to r-goitrin. the inhibitory effect of r-goitrin against influenza viral neuraminidase was revealed by fluorescent enzyme immunoassay method  13] , while s-goitrin is known as an antithyroid factor  .to date, x-ray crystallography, nmr, vibrational circular dichroism (vcd) and enantioselective chromatography have been frequently adopted to determine the chiral components of tcms  2] . several enantioselective chromatography such as reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (rp-hplc) coupled with the type of chrialpak®ic chiral column  20] and supercritical fluid chromatography (sfc) have been used for chiral separation of r,s-goitrin in r. isatidis  22] . however, these methods were limited owing to the complex operation, high cost, and lack of simultaneous quantification of other chiral glucosinolates. therefore, it is desired and urgent to establish a more efficient enantioselective method to simultaneously quantify the four glucosinolates, and furthermore resolve rand s-goitrin for the effective use and quality control of r. isatidis and its granules.in the present study, a high-performance liquid chromatography/diode array detector coupled with circular dichroism detection (hplc-dad-cd) was adopted to develop a more efficient method for simultaneous separation and quantification of the four chiral glucosinolates-epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, r-goitrin, and s-goitrin-in r. isatidis. progoitrin, epiprogoitrin and rand s-goitrin were simultaneously determined using hplc-uv, whereas r-goitrin was detected and quantified by coupling with cd detection. through the linear relations between anisotropy factor (g = ∆a cd /a uv ) and the percent optical purity of r-goitrin, the contents of r-goitrin and s-goitrin in the mixture r,s-goitrin was calculated. furthermore, glucosinolate profiling of 37 samples from crude drugs, decoction pieces, and granules of r. isatidis was carried out to clarify their chemical characteristics and to find their content distribution.results and discussionin order to obtain the best chemical information and separation mechanism in chromatograms, different hplc parameters including various mobile gases, detection wavelengths, and gradient sample availability: not available.","Yanhong Shi, Cheng Zheng, Jinhang Li, Li Yang, Zhengtao Wang, Rui Wang"

6370,"SARS-CoV Pathogenesis Is Regulated by a STAT1 Dependent but a Type I, II and III Interferon Receptor Independent Mechanism","abstractsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) infection often caused severe end stage lung disease and organizing phase diffuse alveolar damage, especially in the elderly. the virus-host interactions that governed development of these acute end stage lung diseases and death are unknown. to address this question, we evaluated the role of innate immune signaling in protection from human (urbani) and a recombinant mouse adapted sars-cov, designated rma15. in contrast to most models of viral pathogenesis, infection of type i, type ii or type iii interferon knockout mice (129 background) with either urbani or ma15 viruses resulted in clinical disease outcomes, including transient weight loss, denuding bronchiolitis and alveolar inflammation and recovery, identical to that seen in infection of wildtype mice. this suggests that type i, ii and iii interferon signaling play minor roles in regulating sars pathogenesis in mouse models. in contrast, infection of stat12/2 mice resulted in severe disease, high virus titer, extensive pulmonary lesions and 100% mortality by day 9 and 30 post-infection with rma15 or urbani viruses, respectively. non-lethal in balb/c mice, urbani sars-cov infection in stat12/2 mice caused disseminated infection involving the liver, spleen and other tissues after day 9. these findings demonstrated that sars-cov pathogenesis is regulated by a stat1 dependent but type i, ii and iii interferon receptor independent, mechanism. in contrast to a well documented role in innate immunity, we propose that stat1 also protects mice via its role as an antagonist of unrestrained cell proliferation. citation: frieman mb, chen j, morrison te, whitmore a, funkhouser w, et al.

8995,High-Mannose But Not Complex-Type Glycosylation of Tetherin Is Required for Restriction of HIV-1 Release,"abstracttetherin is an interferon-inducible antiviral protein that inhibits the release of a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses by retaining virions at the surface of infected cells. while the role of specific tetherin domains in antiviral activity is clearly established, the role of glycosylation in tetherin function is not clear. in this study, we carried out a detailed investigation of this question by using tetherin variants in which one or both sites of n-linked glycosylation were mutated (n65a, n92a, and n65,92a), and chemical inhibitors that prevent glycosylation at specific stages of oligosaccharide were added or modified. the single n-linked glycosylation mutants, n65a and n92a, efficiently inhibited the release of vpu-defective human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1). in contrast, the non-glycosylated double mutant, n65,92a, lost its ability to block hiv-1 release. the inability of the n65,92a mutant to inhibit hiv-1 release is associated with a lack of cell-surface expression. a role for glycosylation in cell-surface tetherin expression is supported by tunicamycin treatment, which inhibits the first step of n-linked glycosylation and impairs both cell-surface expression and antiviral activity. inhibition of complex-type glycosylation with kifunensine, an inhibitor of the oligosaccharide processing enzyme mannosidase 1, had no effect on either the cell-surface expression or antiviral activity of tetherin. these results demonstrate that high-mannose modification of a single asparagine residue is necessary and sufficient, while complex-type glycosylation is dispensable, for cell-surface tetherin expression and antiviral activity. ectodomain, and a c-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi) anchor  14, 15] . the ct of tetherin contains an ""sts"" sequence that is implicated in ubiquitylation, and a highly-conserved tyrosine-based motif, ""yxxy"", that is essential for clathrin-dependent endocytosis of tetherin, and activation of nuclear factor-κb (nf-κb)     . the tm and gpi anchor provide two membrane anchors that enable tetherin to tether virions with one domain in the viral envelope and the other in the plasma membrane (pm) of the host cell. the specific sequence of the tm domain is implicated in the interaction between tetherin and its antagonists such as vpu. the ectodomain of human tetherin contains three cys residues that are required for the formation of homodimers  20] . du pont et al. recently demonstrated that disulfide bonds are not required for maintaining the coiled-coil or dimeric structure of tetherin, however, dimerization is necessary for tetherin's antiviral activity  . the ectodomain also contains two asn residues at positions 65 and 92 that are post-translationally modified with n-linked oligosaccharides  15, 20, 22] . deletion of the ct, tm, cc, or gpi domains, or mutating the cys residues that are required for protein dimerization, abrogates the ability of tetherin to inhibit virus release  15, 20] .tetherin inhibits the release of not only hiv-1 but also that of a broad spectrum of other enveloped viruses, including alphaviruses, filoviruses, rhabdoviruses, arenaviruses, herpesviruses, paramyxoviruses, flaviviruses, orthohepadnaviruses, orthomyxoviruses, and other retroviruses (reviewed in    ). many of these viruses have evolved diverse strategies to antagonize tetherin. hiv-1 vpu counteracts human tetherin by reducing its cell-surface expression via lysosomal and proteasomal degradation          or by trapping tetherin intracellularly and/or preventing its recycling back to the pm -38]. the specificity of hiv-1 vpu towards tetherin antagonism also varies from species to species. hiv-1 vpu counteracts tetherins from human, chimpanzee, and gorilla; however, it is relatively inactive against tetherin from other non-human primates and non-primates      . simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) and hiv-2, which do not encode a vpu gene, antagonize tetherin through their nef and envelope (env) proteins, respectively, in part through an intracellular sequestration mechanism  39,        .as mentioned above, human tetherin contains two putative n-linked glycosylation sites in the extracellular cc domain. the requirement for tetherin glycosylation in the inhibition of virus release remains controversial. early studies reported that n-linked glycosylation of asn 65 (n65) and 92 (n92) is important for the inhibition of hiv-1 release        . however, other studies found that mutating n65 and n92 had a negligible effect on tetherin restriction of hiv-1 release  55, 56] . some studies reported a correlation between tetherin restriction of virus release and tetherin cell-surface expression  50] , while others did not observe this correlation  53, 54, 57] . while some studies were carried out with human tetherin, others used tetherins from other species. studies also differed in their use of viral system to examine tetherin restriction; some studies were carried out with 20, 50, 53, 54] whereas others used feline immunodeficiency virus , prototypical foamy virus , xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus , bovine leukemia virus , severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)-coronavirus , lassa fever virus, and marburg viruses .asn-linked (n-linked) glycosylation is a highly regulated, post-translational modification that is important for the structure and function of eukaryotic proteins. n-linked glycosylation is initiated in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (er) with the cotranslational transfer of a high-mannose oligosaccharide moiety to asn residues in asn-x-ser/thr motifs (where x is any amino acid except pro) in the target protein. trimming of the high-mannose side chains occurs in the er and golgi apparatus, and additional sugars (e.g., galactose, fucose, and sialic acid) are attached to generate complex side chains. the glycoprotein is then exported to the pm through the secretory pathway  . when transiently overexpressed in 293t cells, several forms of tetherin are detected: the non-glycosylated 23-kda species, and forms bearing high-mannose modification on either (≈24.5 kda) or both (≈26 kda) asn 65 and 92, and complex-type carbohydrates at either or both positions (≈32 to 40 kda)  15, 34, 59] .","Abdul A Waheed, Ariana Gitzen, Maya Swiderski, Eric O Freed"
10826,"Potential disease transmission from wild geese and swans to livestock, poultry and humans: a review of the scientific literature from a One Health perspective","abstractthere are more herbivorous waterfowl (swans and geese) close to humans, livestock and poultry than ever before. this creates widespread conflict with agriculture and other human interests, but also debate about the role of swans and geese as potential vectors of disease of relevance for human and animal health. using a one health perspective, we provide the first comprehensive review of the scientific literature about the most relevant viral, bacterial, and unicellular pathogens occurring in wild geese and swans. research thus far suggests that these birds may play a role in transmission of avian influenza virus, salmonella, campylobacter, and antibiotic resistance. on the other hand, at present there is no evidence that geese and swans play a role in transmission of newcastle disease, duck plague, west nile virus, vibrio, yersinia, clostridium, chlamydophila, and borrelia. finally, based on present knowledge it is not possible to say if geese and swans play a role in transmission of escherichia coli, pasteurella, helicobacter, brachyspira, cryptosporidium, giardia, and microsporidia. this is largely due to changes in classification and taxonomy, rapid development of identification methods and lack of knowledge about host specificity. previous research tends to overrate the role of geese and swans as disease vectors; we do not find any evidence that they are significant transmitters to humans or livestock of any of the pathogens considered in this review. nevertheless, it is wise to keep poultry and livestock separated from small volume waters used by many wild waterfowl, but there is no need to discourage livestock grazing in nature reserves or pastures where geese and swans are present. under some circumstances it is warranted to discourage swans and geese from using wastewater ponds, drinking water reservoirs, and public beaches. intensified screening of swans and geese for aiv, west nile virus and anatid herpesvirus is warranted.article history","Johan Elmberg, Charlotte Berg, Henrik Lerner, Jonas Waldenström, Rebecca Hessel"

3227,"Phylogenetic Distribution of CMP-Neu5Ac Hydroxylase (CMAH), the Enzyme Synthetizing the Proinflammatory Human Xenoantigen Neu5Gc","abstractthe enzyme cmp-n-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (cmah) is responsible for the synthesis of n-glycolylneuraminic acid (neu5gc), a sialic acid present on the cell surface proteins of most deuterostomes. the cmah gene is thought to be present in most deuterostomes, but it has been inactivated in a number of lineages, including humans. the inability of humans to synthesize neu5gc has had several evolutionary and biomedical implications. remarkably, neu5gc is a xenoantigen for humans, and consumption of neu5gc-containing foods, such as red meats, may promote inflammation, arthritis, and cancer. likewise, xenotransplantation of organs producing neu5gc can result in inflammation and organ rejection. therefore, knowing what animal species contain a functional cmah gene, and are thus capable of endogenous neu5gc synthesis, has potentially far-reaching implications. in addition to humans, other lineages are known, or suspected, to have lost cmah; however, to date reports of absent and pseudogenic cmah genes are restricted to a handful of species. here, we analyze all available genomic data for nondeuterostomes, and 322 deuterostome genomes, to ascertain the phylogenetic distribution of cmah. among nondeuterostomes, we found cmah homologs in two green algae and a few prokaryotes. within deuterostomes, putatively functional cmah homologs are present in 184 of the studied genomes, and a total of 31 independent gene losses/pseudogenization events were inferred. our work produces a list of animals inferred to be free from endogenous neu5gc based on the absence of cmah homologs and are thus potential candidates for human consumption, xenotransplantation research, and model organisms for investigation of human diseases.","Sateesh Peri, Asmita Kulkarni, Felix Feyertag, Patricia M Berninsone, David Alvarez-Ponce"

it would overcome the small molecules drugs, which are susceptible to transmembrane diffusion  . nanomedicine offers several nanoparticulate platforms such as liposomes, liposome composites, lipid micelles, polymer micelles, polymer drug conjugates, dendrimers, protein carriers, biologically synthesized nanoparticles, and inorganic nanoparticles, as a drug delivery vehicle and some cases nanoparticles acting as cytotoxic and bio-imaging agents. veterinary medicine is an important aspect taking care of health care in dairy industry to overcome the significant economic loss.domestic livestock are primary source for the living and getting revenue of more than 600 million farmers in developing countries and contribute to about 30-35 per cent of agricultural gross domestic product  . devastating outbreaks of new diseases and re-emergence of old infections in animals lead to unbelievable loss of income for livestock keepers  . the delay of detection and controlling zoonoses is associated with spread of the vulnerable infection to entire herds and humans. therefore, it is essential to explore the novel technology to prevent and treat the diseases that are caused by various microorganisms to the veterinary animals. the recent development in nanoscience and nanotechnology helps several areas of research and applications in veterinary medicine by developing new diagnostic tools and the development of new forms of treatments, which facilitate increasing the longevity and improve the quality of life of veterinary animals. nanotechnology is specifically defined as the design, characterization, and application of structures, devices, and systems by controlling shape and size at the nanometer scale level (ranging from 1 to 100 nm) and nanomedicine considered to be offers a more strategic approach, these smaller size of particles can encapsulate and deliver drugs to dramatically enhance their effectiveness. associating a therapeutic molecule with a nanoparticle can enhance its solubility by orders of magnitude, allowing for hydrophobic drugs to be carried more easily through the bloodstream. this could help to address a serious challenge in pharmacology, since an estimated 40 per cent of new drugs are poorly soluble in biological fluids  . in addition, nanoparticles can also enable the controlled release of the drug, or deliver two different drugs simultaneously to give a more powerful combination therapy. most of the studies either beneficial or cytotoxic effects have been done on rodents as in vivo models due to the similarity in biochemical and physiological pathways with human metabolism, but limited studies are only available in veterinary animals  . however, the clinical studies were performed in both primary research focused on the treatment and diagnosis of veterinary diseases and translational research in which spontaneous diseases in animals can be used as models of human diseases. based on the literature considering into account, this review focused on the basic principles behind the use of very commonly used nanoparticles for antimicrobial agents, drug delivery, diagnostics, vaccine formulation, feed additive, reproductive aides, animal growth, and animal production. further, we discussed the clinical applications and limitations, providing the int. j. mol. sci. 2018, 19, 3299 3 of 32 reader with a realistic synopsis of the practical applications of nanoparticles to veterinary medicine at present and in the near future.","Ding-Ping Bai, Xin-Yu Lin, Yi-Fan Huang, Xi-Feng Zhang"
5276,Semi-quantitative visual assessment of chest radiography is associated with clinical outcomes in critically ill patients,"abstractbackground: respiratory pathology is a major driver of mortality in the intensive care unit (icu), even in the absence of a primary respiratory diagnosis. prior work has demonstrated that a visual scoring system applied to chest radiographs (cxr) is associated with adverse outcomes in icu patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). we hypothesized that a simple, semi-quantitative cxr score would be associated with clinical outcomes for the general icu population, regardless of underlying diagnosis. methods: all individuals enrolled in the registry of critical illness at brigham and women's hospital between june 2008 and august 2018 who had a cxr within 24 h of admission were included. each patient's cxr was assigned an opacification score of 0-4 in each of four quadrants with the total score being the sum of all four quadrants. multivariable negative binomial, logistic, and cox regression, adjusted for age, sex, race, immunosuppression, a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a history of congestive heart failure, and apache ii scores, were used to assess the total score's association with icu length of stay (los), duration of mechanical ventilation, inhospital mortality, 60-day mortality, and overall mortality, respectively.results: a total of 560 patients were included. higher cxr scores were associated with increased mortality; for every one-point increase in score, in-hospital mortality increased 10% (or 1.10, ci 1.05-1.16, p < 0.001) and 60-day mortality increased by 12% (or 1.12, ci 1.07-1.17, p < 0.001). cxr scores were also independently associated with both icu length of stay (rate ratio 1.06, ci 1.04-1.07, p < 0.001) and duration of mechanical ventilation (rate ratio 1.05, ci 1.02-1.07, p < 0.001). conclusions: higher values on a simple visual score of a patient's cxr on admission to the medical icu are associated with increased in-hospital mortality, 60-day mortality, overall mortality, length of icu stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation.","Stefanie E Mason, Paul B Dieffenbach, Joshua A Englert, Angela A Rogers, Anthony F Massaro, Laura E Fredenburgh, Angelica Higuera, Mayra Pinilla-Vera, Marta Vilas, Raul San, Jose Estepar, George R Washko, Rebecca M Baron, Samuel Y Ash"
9581,"Characterization of Rv0888, a Novel Extracellular Nuclease from Mycobacterium tuberculosis OPEN","abstractbacterial extracellular nucleases play important roles in virulence, biofilm formation, utilization of extracellular dna as a nutrient, and degradation of neutrophil dna extracellular traps. however, there is no current data available for extracellular nucleases derived from m. tuberculosis. herein, we have identified and characterized rv0888, an extracellular nuclease in m. tuberculosis. the protein was overexpressed in e. coli, and the purified rv0888 protein was found to require divalent cations for activity, with an optimal temperature and ph of 41 °c and 6.5, respectively. further results demonstrated that rv0888 nuclease activity could be inhibited by four chinese medicine monomers. based on sequence analysis, rv0888 nuclease exhibited no homology with any known extracellular nucleases, indicating that rv0888 is a novel nuclease. site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that the h353, d387, and d438 residues play catalytic roles in rv0888. in vivo infection studies confirmed that rv0888 is required for infection and is related to pathogenicity, as the persistent ability of recombinant mycobacterium smegmatis (rms) rv0888ns/ms and rv0888s/ms is significantly higher than pmv262/ms in the lung tissue, and the rv0888ns/ms and rv0888s/ms could produce pathological changes in the mice lung. these results show that rv0888 is relevant to pathogenicity of m. tuberculosis.a variety of bacteria produce extracellular dnases/nucleases that are important for virulence, biofilm formation, utilization of extracellular dna as a nutrient, and degradation of neutrophil dna extracellular traps (nets). extracellular nucleases produced by shewanella, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus allow these bacteria to degrade extracellular dna to its basic components: phosphate, carbon, and nitrogen 1-3 . a recent study by seper et al. demonstrated that wild-type vibrio cholerae rapidly degraded the dna component of nets through the combined activity of two extracellular nucleases, dns and xds 4 . in s. aureus, an extracellular nuclease also degraded nets, triggering caspase-3-mediated death of immune cells 5 . moreover, nuclease a (gbs0661), an extracellular nuclease of streptococcus agalactiae, is required for full virulence of the organism 6 and attacks nets, which are a component of the host defense response that immobilizes microbes for subsequent clearance by innate immunity machinery, including phagocytosis by macrophages. a mn 2+ -stimulated deoxyribonuclease (nuc b) is released by bacillus subtilis 168 during sporulation in glucose-deficient medium, which degrades structurally important nucleic acids, thereby controlling the development and dispersal of bacterial biofilms 7,8 .mycobacterium tuberculosis (m. tuberculosis) is a gram-positive bacterium that causes tuberculosis (tb), which remains one of the world's deadliest communicable diseases. in 2013, an estimated 9.0 million people contracted tb and a subsequent 1.5 million people died from the disease, of whom 360,000 were hiv-positive 9 . m. tuberculosis is phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells after inhalation into the lung. however, m. tuberculosis can proliferate within these immune cells, eventually escaping from the phagosome and migrating to draining lymph nodes to spread the infection 10-12 . rv0888, a protein that belongs to the large endonuclease/exonuclease/phosphatase family (pfam family pf03372) 13 , has sphingomyelinase activity that has been detected in m. tuberculosis culture filtrates 14 . in this study, we identified and characterized rv0888, the first extracellular nuclease to be reported from m. tuberculosis. we demonstrate that this enzyme is highly active in degrading different types of nucleic acids (chromosomal dna, double-stranded pcr products, plasmid dna, and baker's yeast rna) utilizing divalent metal cations (ca 2+ and mn 2+ ). in addition, the nuclease activity of rv0888 is inhibited by four chinese medicine monomers (oleuropein, 6-gingerol, corylifolinin, and acteoside). finally, we confirmed that rv0888 is relevant to mycobacterial pathogenicity.","Guanghui Dang, Jun Cao, Yingying Cui, Ningning Song, Liping Chen, Hai Pang, Siguo Liu"
3625,Host-Directed Antivirals: A Realistic Alternative to Fight Zika Virus,"abstractzika virus (zikv), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, was an almost neglected pathogen until its introduction in the americas in 2015, where it has been responsible for a threat to global health, causing a great social and sanitary alarm due to its increased virulence, rapid spread, and an association with severe neurological and ophthalmological complications. currently, no specific antiviral therapy against zikv is available, and treatments are palliative and mainly directed toward the relief of symptoms, such as fever and rash, by administering antipyretics, anti-histamines, and fluids for dehydration. nevertheless, lately, search for antivirals has been a major aim in zikv investigations. to do so, screening of libraries from different sources, testing of natural compounds, and repurposing of drugs with known antiviral activity have allowed the identification of several antiviral candidates directed to both viral (structural proteins and enzymes) and cellular elements. here, we present an updated review of current knowledge about anti-zikv strategies, focusing on host-directed antivirals as a realistic alternative to combat zikv infection.","Juan-Carlos Saiz, Nereida Jiménez De Oya, Ana-Belén Blázquez, Estela Escribano, Romero Id, Miguel A Martín-Acebes, I D "
7751,Assessment of the Evolution of Cancer Treatment Therapies,"abstractcancer therapy has been characterized throughout history by ups and downs, not only due to the ineffectiveness of treatments and side effects, but also by hope and the reality of complete remission and cure in many cases. within the therapeutic arsenal, alongside surgery in the case of solid tumors, are the antitumor drugs and radiation that have been the treatment of choice in some instances. in recent years, immunotherapy has become an important therapeutic alternative, and is now the first choice in many cases. nanotechnology has recently arrived on the scene, offering nanostructures as new therapeutic alternatives for controlled drug delivery, for combining imaging and treatment, applying hyperthermia, and providing directed target therapy, among others. these therapies can be applied either alone or in combination with other components (antibodies,cancers 2011, 3 3280 peptides, folic acid, etc.). in addition, gene therapy is also offering promising new methods for treatment. here, we present a review of the evolution of cancer treatments, starting with chemotherapy, surgery, radiation and immunotherapy, and moving on to the most promising cutting-edge therapies (gene therapy and nanomedicine). we offer an historical point of view that covers the arrival of these therapies to clinical practice and the market, and the promises and challenges they present.","Manuel Arruebo, Nuria Vilaboa, Berta Sáez-Gutierrez, Julio Lambea, Alejandro Tres, Mónica Valladares, África González-Fernández"

6891,Investigation of Pathogenesis of H1N1 Influenza Virus and Swine Streptococcus suis Serotype 2 Co-Infection in Pigs by Microarray Analysis a11111 OPEN ACCESS,"abstractswine influenza virus and streptococcus suis are two important contributors to the porcine respiratory disease complex, and both have significant economic impacts. clinically, influenza virus and streptococcus suis co-infections in pigs are very common, which often contribute to severe pneumonia and can increase the mortality. however, the co-infection pathogenesis in pigs is unclear. in the present study, co-infection experiments were performed using swine h1n1 influenza virus and streptococcus suis serotype 2 (ss2). the h1n1-ss2 co-infected pigs exhibited more severe clinical symptoms, serious pathological changes, and robust apoptosis of lungs at 6 days post-infection compared with separate h1n1 and ss2 infections. a comprehensive gene expression profiling using a microarray approach was performed to investigate the global host responses of swine lungs against the swine h1n1 infection, ss2 infection, co-infection, and phosphate-buffered saline control. results showed 457, 411, and 844 differentially expressed genes in the h1n1, ss2, and h1n1-ss2 groups, respectively, compared with the control. noticeably, genes associated with the immune, inflammatory, and apoptosis responses were highly overexpressed in the co-infected group. pathway analysis indicated that the cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, mapk, toll-like receptor, complement and coagulation cascades, antigen processing and presentation, and apoptosis pathway were significantly regulated in the coinfected group. however, the genes related to these were less regulated in the separate h1n1 and ss2 infection groups. this observation suggested that a certain level of synergy was induced by h1n1 and ss2 co-infection with significantly stronger inflammatory and apoptosis responses, which may lead to more serious respiratory disease syndrome and pulmonary pathological lesion.","Xian Lin, Canhui Huang, Jian Shi, Ruifang Wang, Xin Sun, Xiaokun Liu, Lianzhong Zhao, Meilin Jin, Lin X , Huang C , Shi J , Wang R , Sun X Liu"
11032,Temporal patterns and geographic heterogeneity of Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks in French Polynesia and Central America,"abstractbackground. zika virus (zikv) transmission has been reported in 67 countries/territories in the oceania region and the americas since 2015, prompting the world health organization (who) to declare zikv as a public health emergency of international concern in february 2016, due to its strong association with medical complications such as microcephaly and guillain-barré syndrome (gbs). however, a substantial gap in knowledge still exists regarding differing temporal pattern and potential of transmission of zikv in different regions of the world. methods. we use a phenomenological model to ascertain the temporal patterns and transmission potential of zikv in various countries/territories, by fitting the model to zika case data from yap island and french polynesia in the oceania region and 11 countries/territories with confirmed case data, namely, colombia, ecuador, french guiana, guadeloupe, guatemala, mexico, nicaragua, panama, puerto rico, saint martin, and suriname, to pinpoint the waves of infections in each country/territory and to estimate the respective basic reproduction number r 0 . results. six of these time series datasets resulted in statistically significant model fit of at least one wave of reported cases, namely that of french polynesia, colombia, puerto rico, guatemala, suriname and saint martin. however, only colombia and guatemala exhibited two waves of cases while the others had only one wave. temporal patterns of the second wave in colombia and the single wave in suriname are very similar, with the respective turning points separated by merely a week. moreover, the mean estimates of r 0 for colombia, guatemala and suriname, all land-based populations, range between 1.05 and 1.75, while the corresponding mean estimates for r 0 of island populations in french polynesia, puerto rico and saint martin are significantly lower with a range of 5.70-6.89. we also fit the richards model to zika case data from six main archipelagos in french polynesia, suggesting the outbreak in all six island populations occurred during the same time, albeit with different peak time, with mean r 0 range of 3.09-5.05. discussion. using the same modeling methodology, in this study we found a significant difference between transmissibility (as quantified by r 0 ) in island populations as opposed to land-based countries/territories, possibly suggesting an important role of geographic heterogeneity in the spread of vector-borne diseases and its future course, which requires further monitoring. our result has potential implications for planning respective intervention and control policies targeted for island and land-based populations.",Ying-Hen Hsieh

11789,Antiviral Drugs Against Severe Fever With Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus Infection,"abstractsevere fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (sfts) is an emerging tick-borne infectious disease caused by sfts virus (sftsv), which is a novel bunyavirus. sftsv was first isolated from patients who presented with fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and multiorgan dysfunction in china. subsequently, it was found to be widely distributed in southeast asia (korea, japan, and vietnam). sftsv can be transmitted not only from ticks but also from domestic animals, companion animals, and humans. because the case fatality rate of sfts is high (6-30%), development of specific and effective treatment for sfts is required. studies of potential antiviral drugs for sfts-specific therapy have been conducted on existing or newly discovered agents in vitro and in vivo, with ribavirin and favipiravir being the most promising candidates. while animal experiments and retrospective studies have demonstrated the limited efficacy of ribavirin, it was also speculated that ribavirin would be effective in patients with a viral load <1 × 10 6 copies/ml. favipiravir showed higher efficacy than ribavirin against sftsv in in vitro assays and greater efficacy in animal models, even administrated 3 days after the virus inoculation. although clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of favipiravir in sfts patients in japan are underway, this has yet to be confirmed. other drugs, including hexachlorophene, calcium channel blockers, 2 ′ -fluoro-2 ′ -deoxycytidine, caffeic acid, amodiaquine, and interferons, have also been evaluated for their inhibitory efficacy against sftsv. among them, calcium channel blockers are promising because in addition to their efficacy in vitro and in vivo, retrospective clinical data have indicated that nifedipine, one of the calcium channel blockers, reduced the case fatality rate by >5-fold. although further research is necessary to develop sfts-specific therapy, considerable progress has been achieved in this area. here we summarize and discuss recent advances in antiviral drugs against sftsv.keywords: severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus, antiviral, ribavirin, favipiravir frontiers in microbiology |","Lijun Rong, Takashi Irie, Alexander Freiberg, Masayuki Saijo, Mutsuyo Takayama-Ito"

12179,"Emerging Microbes and Infections (2016) 5, e41; Emerging Microbes and Infections","abstractemerging and reemerging viruses that cause respiratory infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndromes coronavirus (sars-cov), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), and influenza viruses, are a significant threat to public health worldwide. although vaccines are the most effective strategy to prevent viral infection, vaccine development is a long process and may be effective only against the corresponding virus. therefore, it is essential to develop antiviral agents for intranasal administration as nonspecific prophylaxis against infection by emerging or reemerging respiratory viruses with epidemic or pandemic potential.cholera toxin (ct), which acts as a mucosal adjuvant to stimulate mucosal and systemic immune responses, has the potential for intranasal application as an immunotherapeutic against infection by respiratory viruses. 1 however, ct can exacerbate lung pathology after influenza virus infection through the induction of il-17, a potent proinflammatory cytokine, because co-administration of an il-17ra neutralizing antibody with ct attenuates lung pathology and increases protection against influenza virus infection. 2 therefore, we hypothesized that intranasal application of a mucosal stimulant that induces antiviral cytokines, except il-17, may be effective against influenza virus infection.in this regard, polyethyleneimine (pei), a mucosal adjuvant, exhibits stronger mucosal adjuvanticity but induces much lower il-17 expression than cholera toxin subunit b (ctb). 3 therefore, for the first time, we tested pei for its potential protective effects against influenza virus infection. ten-week-old specific-pathogen-free (spf) female balb/c mice were anesthetized with pelltobarbitalum natricum. then, 50 μl of pbs containing 20 μg of 25 kd linear pei (polysciences, warrington, pa) or 2.5 μg of ctb (sigma-aldrich, st louis, mo, usa) or pbs alone as a control was intranasally administered twice at 24 and 48 h before challenge with 5 ld 50 influenza virus h1n1 (a/pr/8/34). mouse body weights were monitored every day, and those with greater than 25% loss of their initial body weight were euthanized as described. 4 as shown in figure 1a , the body weight of the mice in the pei-pretreated group remained stable from day 1 to day 5 after h1n1 challenge and then gradually decreased until day 11, for a total loss of 18%, before recovering. by contrast, the body weights of the mice in the ctb-and pbs-pretreated groups decreased significantly beginning on day 2 and reached losses of more than 25% by day 8 and 10, respectively, after h1n1 challenge. the final survival rate of the mice in the pei-pretreated group was 60%, whereas that of the mice in the ctb-and pbs-pretreated groups was 0% ( figure 1b) . we then examined the viral titers in mouse lungs as previously described 5 and found that pei significantly reduced lung viral titers on day 2 after h1n1 challenge, whereas the viral titers in the lungs of mice in the ctb-and pbs-pretreated groups showed no significant differences ( figure 1c ). subsequently, we examined lung sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin as previously described. 2 on day 2 after h1n1 infection, the pulmonary alveoli were relatively intact, and only a few inflammatory cells were observed in the lung tissues of mice in the pei-pretreated group. however, the lungs of mice in the ctb-and pbs-pretreated groups were filled with abundant inflammatory cells ( figure 1d ). these results suggest that intranasal application of pei has efficacy in protecting mice from challenge by influenza virus h1n1.to determine the efficacy of pei against another subtype of influenza virus, we pretreated mice with pbs containing pei or pbs alone and challenged them with 5 ld 50 influenza virus h3n2 (a/guizhou/54/89). mice in the pei-pretreated group were fully protected against h3n2 challenge, showing no significant body weight loss ( figure 1e ) and a 100% survival rate, whereas those in the pbs group lost more than 25% of their body weight and showed a 0% survival rate on day 6 post-challenge ( figure 1f ). therefore, pei-mediated protection against influenza virus infection is not subtype-specific.to elucidate the mechanism of action of pei, we examined the rna levels of ifn-α4, ifn-β, ifn-γ, gm-csf, ifitm3 and il-17 in the lungs of mice pretreated with pei, ctb, and pbs, respectively, before viral challenge using quantitative reverse transcription-pcr (qrt-pcr). as previously reported, some of these cytokines, such as interferon, gm-csf and ifitm3, were effective in protecting against influenza infection. 6-8 as shown in supplementary figure s1 , pei induced a significantly higher rna level of ifn-α4 than ctb or pbs. furthermore, the rna levels of gm-csf and ifitm3 elicited by pei were similar to those induced by ctb but much higher than those induced by pbs. the rna level of il-17 in mice pretreated with ctb, an il-17-inducing adjuvant, was approximately 7-and 42-fold higher than that in mice pretreated with pei and pbs, respectively. these results suggest that ifn-α4, gm-csf, and ifitm3 are 'good cytokines' because they act as protective mediators against influenza virus infection, whereas il-17 is a 'bad cytokine' that exacerbates pathology, primarily in the lung, after influenza infection.in summary, we demonstrated that pei, a mucosal stimulant for topical intranasal administration, is highly effective in preventing influenza virus infection. compared to the bacteria-produced toxin ctb, the chemically synthesized polymer pei is safer for mucosal application in humans. pei has been tested in several clinical trials for gene delivery in vivo, demonstrating a good safety profile. 9 moreover, its low cost of production and abundance makes pei more suitable for urgent and widespread use during a time of influenza epidemic or pandemic.acknowledgements","Biao He, Yuhong Fu, Shuai Xia, Fei Yu, Qian Wang, Lu Lu, Shibo Jiang"
594,Transgenic mice expressing tunable levels of DUX4 develop characteristic facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy-like pathophysiology ranging in severity Title: FSHD-like transgenic mouse models of varying severity,"abstractbackground: all types of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (fshd) are caused by the aberrant myogenic activation of the somatically silent dux4 gene, which initiates a cascade of cellular events ultimately leading to fshd pathophysiology. therefore, fshd is a dominant gain-of-function disease that is amenable to modeling by dux4 overexpression. however, there is large variability in the patient population. typically, progressive skeletal muscle weakness becomes noticeable in the second or third decade of life, yet there are many genetically fshd individuals who develop symptoms much later in life or remain relatively asymptomatic throughout their lives. conversely, in rare cases, fshd may present clinically prior to 5-10 yrs of age, ultimately manifesting as a very severe early onset form of the disease. thus, there is a need to control the timing and severity of pathology in fshd-like models. methods: we have recently described a line of conditional dux4 transgenic mice, flexdux4, that develop a myopathy upon induction of human dux4-fl expression in skeletal muscle. here, we use the flexdux4 mouse crossed with the skeletal muscle-specific and tamoxifen inducible line acta1-mercremer to generate a highly versatile bi-transgenic mouse model with chronic, lowlevel dux4-fl expression and mild pathology, that can be induced to develop more severe fshd-like pathology in a dose-dependent response to tamoxifen. we identified conditions to reproducibly generate models exhibiting mild, moderate, or severe dux4-dependent pathophysiology, and characterized their progression. results: we assayed dux4-fl mrna and protein levels, fitness, strength, global gene expression, histopathology, and immune response, all of which are consistent with an fshd-like myopathic phenotype. importantly, we identified sex-specific and muscle-specific differences that should be considered when using these models for preclinical studies. conclusions: the acta1-mcm;flexdux4 bi-transgenic mouse model expresses a chronic low level of dux4-fl and has mild pathology and detectable muscle weakness. the onset and progression of moderate to severe pathology can be controlled via tamoxifen injection to provide consistent and readily screenable phenotypes for assessing therapies targeting dux4-fl mrna and protein. thus, these fshd-like mouse models can be used to study a range of dux4-fl expression and pathology dependent upon investigator need, through controlled mosaic expression of dux4.in addition to the complex genetic and epigenetic conditions that are required to develop clinical fshd, the pathogenic mechanism is also unusual among neuromuscular diseases. while fshd is an autosomal dominant gain-of-function disease, the pathogenic dux4 gene is typically expressed in only a small fraction (<1%) of myocytes, ultimately leading to debilitating muscle pathology over time  16, 26]. this may account in part for the more common adult onset of clinical symptoms in fshd patients  28] . in addition, it appears that fshd pathology is caused by sporadic bursts of increased dux4-fl expression in differentiated myocytes, which are epigenetically suppressed in healthy and asymptomatic subjects  19, 29] .since these cells are syncytial, the detrimental effects of aberrant dux4-fl expression may be found throughout an fshd myofiber despite expression initially being restricted to a small percentage of myonuclei at any one time . regardless, dux4-fl expression in fshd myocytes and skeletal muscle, even when bursting, is still extremely rare, highly variable, and difficult to detect  16, 19] .since dux4-fl is a transcription factor not typically expressed in healthy muscle, its aberrant expression alters the mrna profiles of numerous genes in myocytes  30, 31] .many of these dux4 target genes, including germline specific genes, cleavage stage genes, and immune system regulators, are not normally expressed in healthy myogenic cells  24, 30, 31 ]. in addition, dux4-fl expression ultimately initiates a cascade of numerous potentially detrimental events including the disruption of proteostasis, nonsense-mediated decay, and mrna splicing mechanisms  32, 33] , altered myogenesis  35] , and induction of apoptosis     . these dux4-mediated changes, either alone or in combination, lead to progressive muscle cell death and ultimately pathology  18] . thus, the dux4-fl mrna and protein are prime targets for therapeutic intervention, and animal models for fshd should be based on dux4-fl expression in adult skeletal muscle.we have previously reported the generation of the flexdux4 (flexd) conditional dux4-fl transgenic line of mice, which contains a dux4 transgene engineered into the rosa26 locus using the flex directional switch system  40] to bypass the embryonic lethality from leaky embryonic expression of this transgene  . upon cre-mediated induction, the transgene recombines to express dux4-fl under control of the rosa26 gene promoter ( figure 1a ). importantly, since many elements within dux4 are prime targets for sequence-based therapies     , the dux4 transgene maintains the exon/intron structure of the endogenous human gene, male acta1-mcm mice were crossed with female rosa26 nzg mice to assess induction of cremediated recombination using our tmx dosage regimens. control or bi-transgenic mice were treated with tmx, as above. whole gastrocnemius muscles were fixed in lacz fixative (0.2%","Takako I Jones, Guo-Liang Chew, Pamela Barraza-Flores,

4131,Prevalence of Pathogens Related to Bovine Respiratory Disease Before and After Transportation in Beef Steers: Preliminary Results,"abstractsimple summary: bovine respiratory disease (brd) affects the lower respiratory tract of cattle, causing high mortality. the syndrome has a multifactorial etiology and transport seems to favor pathogen proliferation. this study investigated the prevalence of different pathogens involved in brd, in the nasal microbiota of beef steers collected before and after a long-distance journey. a total of 56 limousine animals were included, travelling in three different shipments, on the same route from france to southern italy in a semitrailer, on three different days from february to april. prior to shipment (t0) and four days after arrival (t1), two deep nasopharyngeal swabs (dns)/steer were collected and tested by bimolecular analysis. neither bovine viral diarrhea virus (bvdv) nor bovine herpesvirus type 1 (bohv-1) were detected. a higher prevalence of histophilus somni was observed in the dns collected during the third shipment in comparison with those registered during the first and the second one, probably due to a higher prevalence at departure. conversely, the prevalence of bovine coronavirus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, mannheimia haemolytica, mycoplasma bovis and pasteurella multocida was higher on arrival in comparison with departure, confirming data reported in the literature. overall, there were nasal microbiota changes in beef steers, with an increase in the prevalence of pathogens associated with brd after travelling.abstract: bovine respiratory disease (brd) is a serious health and economic problem in the beef industry, which is often associated with transportation and caused by different pathogens. the prevalence of bovine herpesvirus type 1 (bohv-1), bovine adenovirus (badv), bovine viral diarrhea virus (bvdv), bovine coronavirus (bcov), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (brsv), bovine parainfluenza virus (bpiv), pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, histophilus somni, mycoplasma bovis, in the nasal microbiota of beef steers before and after the same long-distance journey from france to southern italy was documented. fifty-six limousine animals of three different shipments, travelling on three different days from february to april, were included. prior to shipment (t0) and four days after arrival (t1), two dns/animal were collected and tested by real time quantitative pcr (qpcr). univariate logistic regression was carried out, considering time and day as fixed factors and the outcome of qpcr for each pathogen as a dependent categorical dichotomous variable (positive/negative, 1/0). the fact that the number of h. somni positive animals were found to be higher in the third shipment than the first and second one, indicating that this pathogen was already present before loading, is relevant. the prevalence of bcov, brsv, m. haemolytica, m. bovis, p. multocida was higher at t1 than t0, suggesting that other factors, such as stress and the epidemiological status of the arrival farm, played a role. the tested animals were not treated before and after transport, and our results are in animals 2019, 9, 1093 2 of 7 agreement with the current literature, supporting the hypothesis that the prevalence of pathogens related to brd would increase after travelling, with an increased risk of pathogens shedding.","Francesco Cirone, Barbara Padalino, Daniele Tullio, Paolo Capozza, Michele Losurdo, Gianvito Lanave, Annamaria Pratelli, A P "
11285,Host Cell Entry of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Involves Macropinocytosis Followed by Proteolytic Activation of the F Protein,"abstractrespiratory syncytial virus (rsv) is a highly pathogenic member of the paramyxoviridae that causes severe respiratory tract infections. reports in the literature have indicated that to infect cells the incoming viruses either fuse their envelope directly with the plasma membrane or exploit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. to study the entry process in human tissue culture cells (hela, a549), we used fluorescence microscopy and developed quantitative, facs-based assays to follow virus binding to cells, endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, membrane fusion, and infection. a variety of perturbants were employed to characterize the cellular processes involved. we found that immediately after binding to cells rsv activated a signaling cascade involving the egf receptor, cdc42, pak1, and downstream effectors. this led to a series of dramatic actin rearrangements; the cells rounded up, plasma membrane blebs were formed, and there was a significant increase in fluid uptake. if these effects were inhibited using compounds targeting na + /h + exchangers, myosin ii, pak1, and other factors, no infection was observed. the rsv was rapidly and efficiently internalized by an actin-dependent process that had all hallmarks of macropinocytosis. rather than fusing with the plasma membrane, the viruses thus entered rab5-positive, fluidfilled macropinosomes, and fused with the membranes of these on the average 50 min after internalization. rab5 was required for infection. to find an explanation for the endocytosis requirement, which is unusual among paramyxoviruses, we analyzed the fusion protein, f, and could show that, although already cleaved by a furin family protease once, it underwent a second, critical proteolytic cleavage after internalization. this cleavage by a furin-like protease removed a small peptide from the f1 subunits, and made the virus infectious.","M A Krzyzaniak, M T Zumstein, J A Gerez, P Picotti, A Helenius"
12076,vaccines The TRIMendous Role of TRIMs in Virus-Host Interactions,"abstractthe innate antiviral response is integral in protecting the host against virus infection. many proteins regulate these signaling pathways including ubiquitin enzymes. the ubiquitin-activating (e1), -conjugating (e2), and -ligating (e3) enzymes work together to link ubiquitin, a small protein, onto other ubiquitin molecules or target proteins to mediate various effector functions. the tripartite motif (trim) protein family is a group of e3 ligases implicated in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions including cell cycle progression, autophagy, and innate immunity. many antiviral signaling pathways, including type-i interferon and nf-κb, are trim-regulated, thus influencing the course of infection. additionally, several trims directly restrict viral replication either through proteasome-mediated degradation of viral proteins or by interfering with different steps of the viral replication cycle. in addition, new studies suggest that trims can exert their effector functions via the synthesis of unconventional polyubiquitin chains, including unanchored (non-covalently attached) polyubiquitin chains. trim-conferred viral inhibition has selected for viruses that encode direct and indirect trim antagonists. furthermore, new evidence suggests that the same antagonists encoded by viruses may hijack trim proteins to directly promote virus replication. here, we describe numerous virus-trim interactions and novel roles of trims during virus infections.vaccines 2017, 5, 23 2 of 38ubiquitin is a key protein in orchestrating immune responses. ubiquitin is a 76-amino-acid protein that associates either covalently or non-covalently with proteins    . interaction of ubiquitin with its targets may influence subcellular localization, signaling, trafficking, protein stability, and cell cycle progression    . the addition of ubiquitin to a protein target is catalyzed by three classes of ubiquitin enzymes. the ubiquitin activating enzyme (e1) binds the c-terminal glycine of the ubiquitin molecule to its active-site cysteine in an atp-dependent manner to form a high-energy thioester bond  2] . interaction of the e1 with ubiquitin exposes a site to enable the recruitment of the next enzyme  . via a trans-thiolation reaction, the ubiquitin is transferred from the e1 to the e2 active-site cysteine  2] . once the ubiquitin is bound, an e3 ubiquitin ligase can interact with an e2-ubiquitin conjugase and assist in the transfer of the ubiquitin from the e2 onto a target protein  2] . when covalently attaching ubiquitin to a protein, most often the ubiquitin is covalently linked at the lysine (k) ε-amino group  2] .since ubiquitin has seven lysine residues itself, k6, 11, 27, 29, 33, 48, and 63, the ubiquitin enzymes can coordinate the formation of covalently linked polyubiquitin (poly-ub) chains  2] . in addition, ubiquitin molecules can be linked in a head-to-tail orientation in which the donor ubiquitin's c-terminal glycine is linked to the acceptor ubiquitin's methionine-1 amino group . the e2 primarily determines the ubiquitin chain topology  5] while the e3 is more important in identification and recruitment of the appropriate target  . ubiquitin can be covalently linked to a protein as a single ubiquitin at one site (monoubiquitination), single ubiquitin molecules at multiple lysine residues of the same target protein (multi-monoubiquitination), or a covalently linked chain of ubiquitin to a single lysine (poly-ub) . additionally, ubiquitination enzymes can synthesize unanchored poly-ub chains, which are not covalently attached to any other protein, and act as a ligand for proteins containing a ubiquitin-binding domain (ubd)  4, 6, 7] . in addition to the complexity of chain length and topology, phosphorylation and acetylation of ubiquitin has also been identified  9] . the unique combination of poly-ub chain topologies, covalent or non-covalent modifications, and chain length variation allows for precise signaling regulation.the host encodes a variety of mechanisms to enact, regulate, and interpret this complex 'ubiquitin code.' ubiquitin modification can directly influence the target molecule through induction of a conformational change. such changes may recruit other molecules, expose a subcellular localization sequence, or alter protein stability  3] . recognition of ubiquitin by ubd-containing proteins is analogous to a receptor binding its ligand. the ubd-containing proteins may recognize a specific poly-ub chain topology (e.g., ubd specifically recognizing k48-linked poly-ub chains) and/or chain length (e.g., a ubd that interacts with monoubiquitin) and then recruit specific molecules to create a signaling complex  3, 10] . although some exceptions exist, different poly-ub chain topologies are associated with particular effector responses. the best-characterized examples of chain topologies include k48-linked poly-ub chains, which stereotypically target proteins for proteasome-mediated degradation, or k63-linked poly-ub chains, which generally coordinate cell signaling complexes and subcellular localization  3] . despite the canonical roles of these chain topologies, k48-linked poly-ub chains have been noted to be involved in promoting signaling complex assembly  and k63-linked poly-ub chains can mark protein targets for degradation  . to regulate the ubiquitin response, the host also encodes deubiquitinating enzymes (dub) or ubiquitin specific proteases (usp), which can disassemble poly-ub chains or coordinate the removal of ubiquitinated enzymes  3] . overall, the host encodes the enzymes necessary to generate, respond to, and eliminate ubiquitin modifications.tripartite motif proteins (trims) are an e3 ligase family critical in many cellular functions, including the regulation and coordination of innate immunity and antiviral responses  7,     . trims are known to coordinate the ubiquitination of target proteins to assemble signaling complexes, mediate proteolytic degradation, alter subcellular localization, or modulate the host's transcript or vaccines 2017, 5, 23 3 of 38 protein composition (reviewed in: ). trim proteins are such named due to their conserved rbcc domain. the rbcc domain includes a really interesting new gene (ring) e3 ligase domain (r), one or two b-box domains (b), and a coiled-coil domain (cc) . like other ring motif-containing e3 ligases, the ring domain of trims usually mediates the interaction with ubiquitin-bound e2 via the zinc finger motifs  4, 17] . these motifs are comprised of key cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate binding to two zinc ions and facilitate protein-protein interactions  4, 17] . the function of the b-box is less well characterized, however studies suggest that this domain is important in coordinating trim self-association and protein-protein interactions, as well as promoting formation of higher-order trim oligomerization (reviewed in  ). since the b-box domain also contains a zinc finger motif, it has been suspected to confer e3 ubiquitin ligase activity to some trims  20] , although it does not appear to be a general feature of the trim family  . some trims include only a b-box 2 domain, while others encode a b-box 1 followed by a b-box 2  18] .the coiled-coil domain is a hyper-helical structure that allows for dimerization and self-association of trims  18, 21, 22] . crystal structures and biochemical analyses of the coiled-coil regions of trim5α, trim20, trim25 and trim69 indicate that the trim dimers are formed by coiled-coil antiparallel helical structures      , and bioinformatics analysis suggest that this could be a general characteristic of the trim family  . often, dimerization of trims via the coiled-coil domain and formation of higher order oligomerization through the b-box domain is critical for trim function and e3 ligase activity  21, 23,     . furthermore, in some cases, the antiparallel nature of the coiled-coil dimers and the formation of higher order oligomers allows for dimerization of ring domains, which are also important for enzymatic activity  23] . however, the presence of one or two b-box domains, or the presence of different c-terminal regions, may affect dimerization and/or higher order oligomerization of trims. in fact, the oligomerization mode of trim32 and trim25, which contain one and two b-box domains respectively, differs greatly and is critical for their function  . prediction of trim structure and function is further complicated by differences in trim domain composition. for example, although trim members are characterized by the presence of an rbcc, some trim-like members, including trim14 and trim16, lack a ring domain within the rbcc  30] .the variable c-terminal region of trims is responsible primarily for interaction with target proteins and subcellular localization  18, 31] . to date, 11 classes of trim c-terminal domains have been characterized  17, 18] . the most prevalent trim c-terminal domain is the b30.2, or pry-spry, domain with approximately 40 members identified in humans  17, 32] . trims post-translational modifications       , alternatively spliced isoforms  38, 39] , and heterodimerization  19] expand the diversity and functionality of this protein family. the expanding interest in trims relates to the realization that these proteins play crucial roles in regulating responses to pathogens, autoimmune pathologies, and cancer.the evolutionary history of trims in vertebrates correlates with the role of this e3 ligase family in regulating responses to viral infection. though present in invertebrates, the trim family is greatly diversified in vertebrates coinciding with the evolution of the interferon (ifn) pathway and adaptive immune system  38] . further, several trims are clustered within chromosomes    . the clustering of closely related trims suggests they evolved due to gene duplication     . the close proximity of several trims, particularly those with a b30.2 domain, near known immune genes such as hla (human leukocyte antigen)    supports immune regulation as a trim-mediated function. additionally, the regulatory regions of several trims include target sequences recognized by transcription factors involved in coordinating immune responses  . the species-specific expansion of b30.2-containing trims  43] suggests that this group is specialized. in humans, the 10 trims without murine orthologs all contain a b30.2 domain  . additionally, the region encoding the c-terminus of many trims is under positive selection  39, 41, 43, 44] . the non-coding, transcriptional regulatory regions of more recently evolved trim genes are also","Sarah Van Tol, Adam Hage, Maria Isabel Giraldo, Preeti Bharaj, Ricardo Rajsbaum, Angela L Rasmussen, Juliet Morrison"
11974,Dogs (Canis familiaris) as Sentinels for Human Infectious Disease and Application to Canadian Populations: A Systematic Review,"abstractin a world where climate change, vector expansion, human activity, and pathogen dispersal do not respect boundaries, the human-animal-pathogen interface has become less defined. consequently, a one health approach to disease surveillance and control has generated much interest across several disciplines. this systematic review evaluates current global research on the use of domestic dogs as sentinels for human infectious disease, and critically appraises how this may be applied within canada. results highlighted a bias in research from highand middle-income-economy countries, with 35% of the studies describing data from the latin america/caribbean region, 25% from north america, and 11% from the european/central asia region. bacteria were the most studied type of infectious agent, followed by protozoa, viruses, helminths, and fungi. only six out of 142 studies described disease in canada: four researched a variety of pathogens within indigenous communities, one researched borrelia burgdorferi in british columbia, and one researched arboviruses in quebec. results from this review suggest that dogs could provide excellent sentinels for certain infectious-disease pathogens in canada, yet are currently overlooked. further research into the use of dog-sentinel surveillance is specifically recommended for california serogroup viruses, chikungunya virus, west nile virus, lyme borreliosis, rickettsia spp., ehrlichia spp., and dirofilaria immitis.","Natasha H Bowser, Neil E Anderson"
6275,High resolution metagenomic characterization of complex infectomes in paediatric acute respiratory infection,"abstractthe diversity of pathogens associated with acute respiratory infection (ari) makes diagnosis challenging. traditional pathogen screening tests have a limited detection range and provide little additional information. we used total rna sequencing (""meta-transcriptomics"") to reveal the full spectrum of microbes associated with paediatric ari. throat swabs were collected from 48 paediatric ari patients and 7 healthy controls. samples were subjected to meta-transcriptomics to determine the presence and abundance of viral, bacterial, and eukaryotic pathogens, and to reveal mixed infections, pathogen genotypes/subtypes, evolutionary origins, epidemiological history, and antimicrobial resistance. we identified 11 rna viruses, 4 dna viruses, 4 species of bacteria, and 1 fungus. while most are known to cause aris, others, such as echovirus 6, are rarely associated with respiratory disease. co-infection of viruses and bacteria and of multiple viruses were commonplace (9/48), with one patient harboring 5 different pathogens, and genome sequence data revealed large intra-species diversity. expressed resistance against eight classes of antibiotic was detected, with those for mls, bla, tet, phe at relatively high abundance. in summary, we used a simple total rna sequencing approach to reveal the complex polymicrobial infectome in ari. this provided comprehensive and clinically informative information relevant to understanding respiratory disease.acute respiratory infections (ari) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in newborns and young children, who experience an average of 3 to 6 aris annually 1-3 . identifying the diversity of pathogens responsible for aris remains challenging because they involve a diverse set of viruses, bacteria, and fungal pathogens, with co-infection among them commonplace 4,5 . traditional testing methods such as pcr, serological typing, bacterial culture and antibody detection, are regarded as the ""gold standard"" and widely used in ari diagnosis 6,7 . however, despite an ongoing effort to include multiple pathogens in a single assay 8,9 , it remains difficult to simultaneously identify all potential ari pathogens and capture new or uncommon respiratory pathogens 10 .metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mngs) is an unbiased way of discovering a broad range of infectious agents 11-13 , and has been recently introduced into clinical research to investigate the microbial cause of unusual disease cases 14 , perform broad-scale surveys for pathogens in undiagnosed diseases 15, 16 , and understand the role of opportunistic infections 17, 18 . for example, a study of severe pneumonia revealed that mngs is both efficient and reliable 19, 20 . importantly, the utility of mngs goes beyond pathogen identification. in particular, total rna sequencing (""meta-transcriptomics"") has successfully revealed the entire ""infectome"" (viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes) present within an organism and provided relevant data on genome sequence, gene expression, open scientific reports | (2020) 10:3963 |   and pathogen abundance 21-26 . in addition, the focus on expressed rna means that the sequence data generated is not dominated by those from the host genome, in turn simplifying pathogen discovery.herein, we used meta-transcriptomics to investigate the infectious causes of ari in 48 children attending a single hospital in china over a defined time-period. our aim was to characterize the complex infectome of aris using a straightforward yet powerful approach that provides plentiful information in addition to identifying the likely pathogen, establishing a bench-mark for future studies in this area. accordingly, the total spectrum of microbes present in patient throat swabs samples were identified, which involved both complex and diagnostically challenging cases.(2020) 10:3963 |","Ci-Xiu Li, Wei Li, Jun Zhou, Bing Zhang, Yan Feng, Chang-Ping Xu, Yi-Yu Lu, Edward C Holmes, Mang Shi"
8813,Transcriptomic analysis of immune response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide in zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata),"abstractbackground: despite the convergence of rapid technological advances in genomics and the maturing field of ecoimmunology, our understanding of the genes that regulate immunity in wild populations is still nascent. previous work to assess immune function has relied upon relatively crude measures of immunocompetence. however, with next-generation rna-sequencing, it is now possible to create a profile of gene expression in response to an immune challenge. in this study, captive zebra finch (taeniopygia guttata; adult males) were challenged with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps) or vehicle to stimulate the innate immune system. 2 hours after injection, birds were euthanized and hypothalami, spleen, and red blood cells (rbcs) were collected. taking advantage of the fully sequenced genome of zebra finch, total rna was isolated, sequenced, and partially annotated in these tissue/cells. results: in hypothalamus, there were 707 significantly upregulated transcripts, as well as 564 and 144 in the spleen and rbcs, respectively, relative to controls. also, 155 transcripts in the hypothalamus, 606 in the spleen, and 61 in the rbcs were significantly downregulated. more specifically, a number of immunity-related transcripts (e.g., il-1β, rsad2, socs3) were upregulated among tissues/cells. additionally, transcripts involved in metabolic processes (apod, lrat, rbp4) were downregulated. conclusions: these results suggest a potential trade-off in expression of genes that regulate immunity and metabolism in birds challenged with lps. this finding is consistent with a hypothermic response to lps treatment in small birds. unlike mammals, birds have nucleated rbcs, and these results support a novel transcriptomic response of avian rbcs to immune challenge.","Cassandra S Scalf, Julia H Chariker, Eric C Rouchka, Noah T Ashley"

5350,Discovery of an antibody for pan- ebolavirus therapy OPEN,"abstractduring the latest outbreak of ebola virus disease in west africa, monoclonal antibody therapy (e.g., zmapp) was utilized to treat patients. however, due to the antigenic differences among the five ebolavirus species, the current therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are only effective against viruses of the species zaire ebolavirus. although this particular species has indeed caused the majority of human infections in central and, recently, west africa, other ebolavirus species (e.g., sudan ebolavirus and bundibugyo ebolavirus) have also repeatedly caused outbreaks in central africa and thus should not be neglected in the development of countermeasures against ebolaviruses. here we report the generation of an ebolavirus glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibody that effectively inhibits cellular entry of representative isolates of all known ebolavirus species in vitro and show its protective efficacy in mouse models of ebolavirus infections. this novel neutralizing monoclonal antibody targets a highly conserved internal fusion loop in the glycoprotein molecule and prevents membrane fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes. the discovery of this highly cross-neutralizing antibody provides a promising option for broad-acting ebolavirus antibody therapy and will accelerate the design of improved vaccines that can selectively elicit cross-neutralizing antibodies against multiple species of ebolaviruses.ebolaviruses, members of the family filoviridae, cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates, with human case fatality rates of up to 90% 1,2 . as proven by the latest epidemic of ebola virus disease (evd) in west africa, ebolaviruses pose a significant public health concern. however, no effective prophylaxis or treatment for evd is as yet commercially available. five distinct species are known in the genus ebolavirus, zaire ebolavirus, sudan ebolavirus, taï forest ebolavirus, bundibugyo ebolavirus, and reston ebolavirus, represented by ebola virus (ebov), sudan virus (sudv), taï forest virus (tafv), bundibugyo virus (bdbv), and reston virus (restv), respectively 3 . of these, ebov, sudv, and bdbv have caused evd outbreaks with increased frequency in central and west africa in the last decade 1,2,4 .ebolaviruses express a single transmembrane glycoprotein (gp) that is responsible for both receptor binding and membrane fusion, and thus the only known target of neutralizing antibodies. gp undergoes proteolytic cleavage by host proteases such as furin, resulting in the two subunits, gp1 and gp2, which are linked by a disulfide bond 5,6 . the gp1 subunit (amino acids 33-501) contains the core of the glycoprotein, receptor binding domain (rbd), a glycan cap, and a large mucin-like domain which extends around the rbd 7 . the gp2 (amino acids 502-676) subunit contains the internal fusion loop (ifl), heptad repeats 1 and 2 (hr1 and hr2), the transmembrane region (tm), and the cytoplasmic tail (ct) 8 . during the transport of ebolavirus particles to late endosomes, low ph leads to proteolytic processing of gps by host cysteine proteases such as cathepsins 9 , and the exposed receptor binding site of the proteolytically digested gp is thought to interact with a host receptor, niemann pick c1, followed by membrane fusion 8, 10, 11 .several studies have demonstrated that administration of ebov gp-specific antibodies protects nonhuman primates from lethal ebov infection and may constitute a leading treatment option for evd in humans      . during the west african evd outbreak, ebov gp-specific monoclonal antibody (mab) cocktails (e.g., zmapp) 12 , were used to treat several patients 17-20 . however, most of characterized therapeutic mabs to date are ebov gp-specific and cross-neutralizing activity against any other ebolavirus species (e.g., sudv and","Wakako Furuyama, Andrea Marzi, Asuka Nanbo, Elaine Haddock, Junki Maruyama, Hiroko Miyamoto, Manabu Igarashi, Reiko Yoshida, Osamu Noyori, Heinz Feldmann, Ayato Takada"

6455,Analysis of VSV pseudotype virus infection mediated by rubella virus envelope proteins OPEN,"abstractto assess the susceptibility of individual cell lines, we generated a pseudotype vesicular stomatitis virus bearing rv envelope proteins (vsv-rv/ce2e1). vsv-rv/ce2e1 entered cells in an rv envelope proteindependent manner, and thus the infection was neutralized completely by an rv-specific antibody. the infection was ca 2+ -dependent and inhibited by endosomal acidification inhibitors, further confirming the dependency on rv envelope proteins for the vsv-rv/ce2e1 infection. human non-immune cell lines were mostly susceptible to vsv-rv/ce2e1, while immune cell lines were much less susceptible than non-immune cell lines. however, susceptibility of immune cells to vsv-rv/ce2e1 was increased upon stimulation of these cells. our data therefore suggest that immune cells are generally less susceptible to rv infection than non-immune cells, but the susceptibility of immune cells is enhanced upon stimulation.rubella is an acute infectious viral disease characterized by low-grade fever, a short-lived morbilliform rash, and lymphadenopathy 1 . additionally, arthritis often develops in rubella patients, particularly in adolescents and adult female patients, and encephalitis, while rare, is a severe complication of this disease. most importantly, neonates born from mothers who suffered from rubella during the first trimester of pregnancy may develop congenital rubella syndrome (crs) and multiple organ malformations. congenital cataracts, sensorineural hearing loss, and cardiovascular defects are most common in crs.rubella virus (rv), the etiologic agent of rubella and crs, belongs to the genus rubivirus in the togaviridae family. despite the great importance of rv to public health, the molecular mechanisms underlying rv pathogenicity remain poorly understood. only humans are the natural hosts for rv, but cell lines from monkeys, hamsters and rabbits such as vero, bhk, and rk-13, respectively, are commonly used for isolation or propagation of rv, because rv replicates most efficiently in these cell lines 2-4 . understanding the cell types targeted by rv and the molecular basis for determining viral tropism is an important step for understanding the pathophysiology of rubella and crs. myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (mog) has been recently identified as a receptor for rv 5 . however, mog is expressed mainly in cells of central nervous system, and its expression is very low or undetectable in the cells from other organs or tissues. since rv generally causes a systemic infection, the pathology of rubella and crs cannot be simply explained by the distribution pattern of mog. previous studies have indicated that membrane phospholipids and glycolipids, rather than cellular surface proteins, support rv infection, suggesting a functional role for membrane lipids in rv infections 6, 7 .vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) belongs to the genus vesiculovirus in the rhabdoviridae family, and the genome is a non-segmented negative-sense rna. a reverse genetics system for vsv has been previously published: xx xx xxxx open  2 scientific reports | 7: 11607 | envelope proteins of different virus species can be incorporated into vsv particles, even when they are provided in trans, generating pseudotype vsvs. pseudotype vsvs enter cells through receptor binding and membrane fusion mediated by incorporated envelope proteins of different viruses, and the entry can be traced with reporter gene expression in the recombinant vsv genome 15-17 . in the present study, various human cell lines were tested for their susceptibility (defined as the capacity for viral entry) to rv using a recombinant vsv pseudotyped with rv proteins.resultsmeasuring the infectivity titer of a virus is fundamental in virus research. however, infectivity titers are not absolute values and are dependent on the host cells used to determine such titers. the host cells must be both susceptible and permissible for virus infection establishment. therefore, even when the viral titer of a particular sample is measured in different cell lines, it may differ greatly. in this experiment, we have determined the 50% cell culture infectious dose (ccid 50 ) by using a limiting dilution method, in which multiple rounds of infection is allowed. however, the ccid 50 in this method is basically expected to show the first cell numbers infected with rv. indeed, even when the second round of infection was blocked by nh 4 cl, similar results were obtained (supplementary figure 1) . the infectivity titer of a stock of the recombinant rv rhs strain was determined using various human cell lines and a monkey kidney-derived cell line, vero. vero cells are most commonly used to determine the infectivity titer of rv. the infectivity titer of the rhs stock was 5.17 × 10 6 ccid 50 /cell when vero cells were used. the titer was set to 100% to simplify comparison (fig. 1a, b) . when njg, jar and jeg3 cells were used, the infectivity titers of the same stock of rhs were 56.1%, 56.7%, and 146%, respectively (fig. 1a) . therefore, the three trophoblast-derived cell lines were susceptible and permissible to rv infection similarly to vero cells. in contrast, the titers were reduced to only ~4 and 18%, respectively, when hsq89 and a549 cells were used (fig. 1a) . the titers were very low (~0.01 to 0.1%), when the other ten non-immune cell lines (sh-sy5y, sk-n-mc, 293t, hueht-1, caco-2, hela, flc-4, huh7, fadu, and detroit562) were used (fig. 1a) . therefore, these cell lines are almost non-susceptible or non-permissible, or both, to rv infection. the titers of the viral stock were also determined using immune cell lines. the titer was ~12% when mt2 cells were used, whereas the titers were very low (~0.01 to 0.1%)","Masafumi Sakata, Hideki Tani, Masaki Anraku, Michiyo Kataoka, Noriyo Nagata, Fumio Seki, Maino Tahara,

10158,Anatomy of the Epidemiological Literature on the 2003 SARS Outbreaks in Hong Kong and Toronto: A Time-Stratified Review,"abstractbackground: outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, especially those of a global nature, require rapid epidemiological analysis and information dissemination. the final products of those activities usually comprise internal memoranda and briefs within public health authorities and original research published in peer-reviewed journals. using the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) epidemic as an example, we conducted a comprehensive time-stratified review of the published literature to describe the different types of epidemiological outputs.we identified and analyzed all published articles on the epidemiology of the sars outbreak in hong kong or toronto. the analysis was stratified by study design, research domain, data collection, and analytical technique. we compared the sars-case and matched-control non-sars articles published according to the timeline of submission, acceptance, and publication. the impact factors of the publishing journals were examined according to the time of publication of sars articles, and the numbers of citations received by sars-case and matched-control articles submitted during and after the epidemic were compared. descriptive, analytical, theoretical, and experimental epidemiology concerned, respectively, 54%, 30%, 11%, and 6% of the studies. only 22% of the studies were submitted, 8% accepted, and 7% published during the epidemic. the submission-to-acceptance and acceptance-to-publication intervals of the sars articles submitted during the epidemic period were significantly shorter than the corresponding intervals of matched-control non-sars articles published in the same journal issues (p,0.001 and p,0.01, respectively). the differences of median submission-to-acceptance intervals and median acceptance-to-publication intervals between sars articles and their corresponding control articles were 106.5 d (95% confidence interval ci] 55.0-140.1) and 63.5 d (95% ci 18.0-94.1), respectively. the median numbers of citations of the sars articles submitted during the epidemic and over the 2 y thereafter were 17 (interquartile range iqr] 8.0-52.0) and 8 (iqr 3.2-21.8), respectively, significantly higher than the median numbers of control article citations (15, iqr 8.5-16.5, p,0.05, and 7, iqr 3.0-12.0, p,0.01, respectively).conclusions: a majority of the epidemiological articles on sars were submitted after the epidemic had ended, although the corresponding studies had relevance to public health authorities during the epidemic. to minimize the lag between research and the exigency of public health practice in the future, researchers should consider adopting common, predefined protocols and ready-to-use instruments to improve timeliness, and thus, relevance, in addition to standardizing comparability across studies. to facilitate information dissemination, journal managers should reengineer their fast-track channels, which should be adapted to the purpose of an emerging outbreak, taking into account the requirement of high standards of quality for scientific journals and competition with other online resources.","Weijia Xing, Gilles Hejblum, Gabriel M Leung, Alain-Jacques Valleron"
4175,Targeting interferon response genes sensitizes aromatase inhibitor resistant breast cancer cells to estrogen-induced cell death,"abstractintroduction: estrogen deprivation using aromatase inhibitors (ais) is currently the standard of care for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. unfortunately, the majority of patients treated with ais eventually develop resistance, inevitably resulting in patient relapse and, ultimately, death. the mechanism by which resistance occurs is still not completely known, however, recent studies suggest that impaired/defective interferon signaling might play a role. in the present study, we assessed the functional role of ifitm1 and plscr1; two well-known interferon response genes in ai resistance. methods: real-time pcr and western blot analyses were used to assess mrna and protein levels of ifitm1, plscr1, stat1, stat2, and irf-7 in ai-resistant mcf-7:5c breast cancer cells and ai-sensitive mcf-7 and t47d cells. immunohistochemistry (ihc) staining was performed on tissue microarrays consisting of normal breast tissues, primary breast tumors, and ai-resistant recurrence tumors. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantitate intracellular ifnα level. neutralizing antibody was used to block type 1 interferon receptor ifnar1 signaling. small interference rna (sirna) was used to knockdown ifitm1, plscr1, stat1, stat2, irf-7, and ifnα expression.results: we found that ifitm1 and plscr1 were constitutively overexpressed in ai-resistant mcf-7:5c breast cancer cells and ai-resistant tumors and that sirna knockdown of ifitm1 significantly inhibited the ability of the resistant cells to proliferate, migrate, and invade. interestingly, suppression of ifitm1 significantly enhanced estradiol-induced cell death in ai-resistant mcf-7:5c cells and markedly increased expression of p21, bax, and noxa in these cells. significantly elevated level of ifnα was detected in ai-resistant mcf-7:5c cells compared to parental mcf-7 cells and suppression of ifnα dramatically reduced ifitm1, plscr1, p-stat1, and p-stat2 expression in the resistant cells. lastly, neutralizing antibody against ifnar1/2 and knockdown of stat1/stat2 completely suppressed ifitm1, plscr1, p-stat1, and p-stat2 expression in the resistant cells, thus confirming the involvement of the canonical ifnα signaling pathway in driving the overexpression of ifitm1 and other interferon-stimulated genes (isgs) in the resistant cells.conclusion: overall, these results demonstrate that constitutive overexpression of isgs enhances the progression of ai-resistant breast cancer and that suppression of ifitm1 and other isgs sensitizes ai-resistant cells to estrogen-induced cell death.","Hye Joung Choi, † , Asona Lui, Joshua Ogony, Rifat Jan, Peter J Sims, Joan Lewis-Wambi"
9286,Screening and Identification of a Chicken Dendritic Cell Binding Peptide by Using a Phage Display Library,"abstractdendritic cells (dcs), as antigen-presenting cells, can initiate adaptive immune responses efficiently. although the dc-targeting strategy has attracted more attention, relevant studies on chicken are rare. here, specific chicken bone marrow dc-binding peptides were selected using a phage display peptide library and confirmed through elisa, flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and laser confocal microscopy. the peptide candidate sphlhtsspwer, named sp, was fused to the infectious bursal disease virus (ibdv) structural protein and protective antigen vp2. in vitro, the expression of dc markers (cd80, cd83, cd86, dec205, and mhcii) and some cytokines (ifn-γ, il-12, tnf-α, il-1β, il-6, and cxcli1) by vp2-sp-stimulated dcs was significantly higher than that by dcs treated with the vp2-control peptide at 4 h (p < 0.001). in addition, an oral vaccine targeting dcs was generated using chicken-borne lactobacillus saerimneri m11 (l. sae m11) to deliver vp2 fused with sp. anti-ibdv mucosal and humoral immune responses were induced efficiently via oral administration, resulting in higher protective efficacy in the vp2-sp group than the vp2 group. therefore, chicken dc targeting of ibdv protective antigen vp2 delivered by l. sae provides effective immune protection in chicken. our study may promote research on the dc-targeting strategy to enhance the effectiveness of chicken vaccines.","Brian Dixon, Analía Berinstein, Javier Santander, Ma S , Qiao X , Xu Y , Wang L , Zhou H , Jiang Y , Cui W , Huang X , Wang X , Li Y , Sunting Ma, Xinyuan Qiao, Yigang Xu, Li Wang, Han Zhou, Yanping Jiang, Wen Cui, Xuewei Huang, Xiaona Wang, Lijie Tang, Yijing Li"

12273,"Loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 trigger autophagy-dependent cell death in glioblastoma cells","abstractautophagy is a well-described degradation mechanism that promotes cell survival upon nutrient starvation and other forms of cellular stresses. in addition, there is growing evidence showing that autophagy can exert a lethal function via autophagic cell death (acd). as acd has been implicated in apoptosis-resistant glioblastoma (gbm), there is a high medical need for identifying novel acd-inducing drugs. therefore, we screened a library containing 70 autophagyinducing compounds to induce atg5-dependent cell death in human mz-54 gbm cells. here, we identified three compounds, i.e. loperamide, pimozide, and stf-62247 that significantly induce cell death in several gbm cell lines compared to crispr/cas9-generated atg5-or atg7-deficient cells, pointing to a death-promoting role of autophagy. further cell death analyses conducted using pharmacological inhibitors revealed that apoptosis, ferroptosis, and necroptosis only play minor roles in loperamide-, pimozide-or stf-62247-induced cell death. intriguingly, these three compounds induce massive lipidation of the autophagy marker protein lc3b as well as the formation of lc3b puncta, which are characteristic of autophagy. furthermore, loperamide, pimozide, and stf-62247 enhance the autophagic flux in parental mz-54 cells, but not in atg5 or atg7 knockout (ko) mz-54 cells. in addition, loperamide-and pimozidetreated cells display a massive formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes at the ultrastructural level. finally, stimulation of autophagy by all three compounds is accompanied by dephosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mtorc1), a well-known negative regulator of autophagy. in summary, our results indicate that loperamide, pimozide, and stf-62247 induce atg5-and atg7-dependent cell death in gbm cells, which is preceded by a massive induction of autophagy. these findings emphasize the lethal function and potential clinical relevance of hyperactivated autophagy in gbm.","Svenja Zielke, Nina Meyer, Muriel Mari, Khalil Abou-El-Ardat, Fulvio Reggiori, Sjoerd J L Van Wijk, Donat Kögel, Simone Fulda"
10296,Molecular Sciences Synthesis and Application of Silver Nanoparticles (Ag NPs) for the Prevention of Infection in Healthcare Workers,"abstractsilver is easily available and is known to have microbicidal effect; moreover, it does not impose any adverse effects on the human body. the microbicidal effect is mainly due to silver ions, which have a wide antibacterial spectrum. furthermore, the development of multidrug-resistant bacteria, as in the case of antibiotics, is less likely. silver ions bind to halide ions, such as chloride, and precipitate; therefore, when used directly, their microbicidal activity is shortened. to overcome this issue, silver nanoparticles (ag nps) have been recently synthesized and frequently used as microbicidal agents that release silver ions from particle surface. depending on the specific surface area of the nanoparticles, silver ions are released with high efficiency. in addition to their bactericidal activity, small ag nps (<10 nm in diameter) affect viruses although the microbicidal effect of silver mass is weak. because of their characteristics, ag nps are useful countermeasures against infectious diseases, which constitute a major issue in the medical field. thus, medical tools coated with ag nps are being developed. this review outlines the synthesis and utilization of ag nps in the medical field, focusing on environment-friendly synthesis and the suppression of infections in healthcare workers (hcws).synthesized by the method (figure 2 )  48] . moreover, no harmful material was generated by the synthesis method.environment-friendly method for ag np synthesis with the diameters control by glucose concentration. we have reported that environment-friendly processes were used to produce small ag nps (<10 nm) within a narrow size distribution. the diameters of generated ag nps were easily controlled by glucose concentrations  .some chemical methods for the synthesis of ag nps include chemical reduction        , electrochemical synthesis -57], the irradiation-assisted method     , and the pyrolysis method  63] , as summarized in table 2 .among them, chemical reduction is well known and requires two main components: a reducing agent and a silver source for the reaction. various reagents are used for reducing agents  50, 51] . of these, borohydride is the most widely used because of its extremely strong and rapid reducing action      . in addition, ag nps synthesized using a co-reduction approach (e.g., sodium borohydride/trisodium citrate , hydrazine hydrate/sodium citrate  , and borohydride/citrate ) were reported. agnihotri et al. reported that ag nps were synthesized employing sodium borohydride as a primary reductant and trisodium citrate both as secondary reductant as well as protective agent  . in this method, nucleation and growth kinetics during the synthesis process were precisely controlled and ag nps of average size 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, 63, 85 , and 100 nm were synthesized with good yield and monodispersity. as described, a protective agent is often added to stabilize the produced nanoparticles in a dispersed state. the crystal structure can also be controlled using this protective agent: rhomboid structures and nanosheets can be produced in addition to the general spherical shape. silver nitrate, which is chemically stable, easily available, and inexpensive compared to other silver salts , can supply silver ions to synthesis systems and is frequently used as the silver source.instead of reducing agents, a silver source is also reduced by electrochemical reaction, irradiation-assisted reaction, and pyrolysis reaction. for example, an electrochemical method, which can be used to produce certain transition metal colloids in the nanometer region, was demonstrated for the first time  . ag nps of ≤ 20 nm can be synthesized using an electrochemical method  56] . using this method, zhang et al. reported new modification method of ultrathin zeolite film of about 400 nm in thickness; the films are promising candidates for use in membrane applications  . recently, ag nps were prepared by an electrochemical method using only polyethylene glycol as a stabilizer and without any other reactant  . interestingly, using irradiation-assisted method, ag nps can be extended easily to synthesize relatively monodisperse triangular silver nanocrystals with desired edge lengths in the 30-120 nm range  and cubic crystal with 2-8 nm lengths  . in addition, irradiation-assisted method contributive to shortening of the synthesis time. according to manikprabhu and lingappa, ag nps were synthesized rapidly in just 90 s from 20 min by a","Shingo Nakamura, Masahiro Sato, Yoko Sato, Naoko Ando, Tomohiro Takayama, Masanori Fujita, Masayuki Ishihara"
10116,Activation of the autophagy pathway by Torovirus infection is irrelevant for virus replication,"abstractautophagy is a conserved eukaryotic process that mediates lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic macromolecules and damaged organelles, also exerting an important role in the elimination of intracellular pathogens. despite the antiviral role of autophagy, many studies suggest that some positive-stranded rna viruses exploit this pathway to facilitate their own replication. in this study, we demonstrate that the equine torovirus berne virus (bev), the prototype member of the torovirus genus (coronaviridae family, nidovirales order), induces autophagy at late times post-infection. conversion of microtubule associated protein 1b light chain 3 (lc3) from cytosolic (lc3 i) to the membrane associated form (lc3 ii), a canonical marker of autophagosome formation, is enhanced in bev infected cells. however, neither autophagy induction, via starvation, nor pharmacological blockade significantly affect bev replication. similarly, bev infection is not altered in autophagy deficient cells lacking either beclin 1 or lc3b protein expression. unexpectedly, the cargo receptor p62, a selective autophagy receptor, aggregates within the region where the bev main protease (m pro ) localizes. this finding, coupled with observation that bev replication also induces er stress at the time when selective autophagy is taking place, suggests that the autophagy pathway is activated in response to the hefty accumulation of virus-encoded polypeptides during the late phase of bev infection.livestock industry, i.e. calves, piglets and foals  . they are enveloped, positive sense, singlestranded rna viruses belonging to the nidovirales order, which includes four families: arteriviridae, roniviridae, mesoviridae and coronaviridae, the latter containing two subfamilies, coronavirinae (genera alpha-, beta-, delta-, and gammacoronavirus) and torovirinae (genera bafinivirus and torovirus) . the international committee on taxonomy of viruses recognizes four torovirus species: human (htov), bovine (btov), porcine (ptov) and equine torovirus (etov) . the prototype member of the torovirus genus is the etov strain berne virus, the first identified torovirus (bev), isolated from a diarrheic horse  . bev was first adapted to cell culture, and for this reason, it is the best characterized torovirus. nevertheless, other cell-culture adapted btov strains are also currently available    .the torovirus genome consists of a single rna molecule (ca. 27 kb) displaying an organization similar to that of other nidoviruses -13]. the first two-thirds of the genome carry two large overlapping open reading frames, orf1a and orf1b, directly translated from the viral genome, rendering two large polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab), which are proteolytically processed by virus-encoded proteases (the papain-like proteinase plp] and the main proteinase m pro ]) to release replication and transcriptional machinery virus components (e.g. the rnadependent rna polymerase rdrp] and the helicase hel] amongst others)  10, 14, 15]. the rest of the viral genome harbors orfs encoding structural proteins: spike (s)  17], membrane (m)  19], hemagglutinin-esterase (he) -22], and nucleocapsid (n)  23], which are individually expressed from a nested set of 3'-coterminal subgenomic mrnas  24, 25].accumulating evidence from different positive-strand rna viruses indicates that in this heterogeneous group of viruses, genome replication and transcription invariably occur in close association with highly modified cellular membranes of diverse origins    . in fact, the presence of double membrane vesicles (dmvs) in the cytoplasm of cells infected with different nidoviruses has been associated with the formation of their replication and transcription complexes (rtcs)        . in this regard, we recently described the presence of dmvs in the cytoplasm of bev-infected cells, providing new evidence supporting the notion that nidoviruses share a common replicative structure based on dmv arranged clusters  . however, the mechanism and host factors required for the generation of these structures remain unknown. because dmv morphology is akin to that of autophagosomes, and given that several pathogens have been shown to hijack the autophagy machinery, it has been postulated that some positive-strand rna viruses may exploit the autophagy machinery to induce dmv formation     .autophagy is a conserved eukaryotic mechanism mediating the removal of long-lived cytoplasmic macromolecules and damaged organelles via a lysosomal degradation pathway to maintain cellular homeostasis. during autophagy, cytoplasmic material is engulfed by doublemembraned vesicles, termed autophagosomes, which are later fused with lysosomes for the degradation of enclosed materials by lysosomal hydrolases  41] . many autophagy-related genes (atg) are involved in the formation and regulation of the autophagy pathway  . the ulk1-atg13-fip200 class iii phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex (pi3k), which contains beclin 1 and vps34, regulates the initiation and nucleation of autophagosome membranes  . furthermore, two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems, i.e. atg12 and atg8/lc3, are involved in the elongation and closure of the autophagosome, converting the cytosolic form of the microtubule associated protein 1b light chain 3 (lc3 i) into the membrane associated type (lc3 ii)  . mammalian cells contain three lc3 isoforms referred to as a,

5463,cells Viroporins in the Influenza Virus,"abstractinfluenza is a highly contagious virus that causes seasonal epidemics and unpredictable pandemics. four influenza virus types have been identified to date: a, b, c and d, with only a-c known to infect humans. influenza a and b viruses are responsible for seasonal influenza epidemics in humans and are responsible for up to a billion flu infections annually. the m2 protein is present in all influenza types and belongs to the class of viroporins, i.e., small proteins that form ion channels that increase membrane permeability in virus-infected cells. in influenza a and b, am2 and bm2 are predominantly proton channels, although they also show some permeability to monovalent cations. by contrast, m2 proteins in influenza c and d, cm2 and dm2, appear to be especially selective for chloride ions, with possibly some permeability to protons. these differences point to different biological roles for m2 in types a and b versus c and d, which is also reflected in their sequences. am2 is by far the best characterized viroporin, where mechanistic details and rationale of its acid activation, proton selectivity, unidirectionality, and relative low conductance are beginning to be understood. the present review summarizes the biochemical and structural aspects of influenza viroporins and discusses the most relevant aspects of function, inhibition, and interaction with the host.in iav, the viral envelope contains cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts and transmembrane glycoproteins hemagglutinin (ha) and neuraminidase (na)  , which are used to further classify iav strains. a third membrane protein is matrix protein 2 (am2 in iav), present in lower abundance  . ha, na, and m2 are type i, type ii, and type iii membrane proteins, respectively    . a layer of matrix protein 1 (m1) just underneath the membrane is the most abundant protein of the virus. m1 forms an internal coat, enclosing the viral ribonucleoproteins as well as three polymerase proteins (pa, pb1, and pb2) that form the viral rna polymerase complex  .iav and ibv have eight negative-sense rna segments, each encoding one or two viral proteins. iav encodes 10-11 proteins: ha, na, np, m1, m2, pa, pb1, pb2, ns1, ns2, and pb1-f2  . ibv has the same proteins as iav, except for the pb1-f2 protein, and has an additional surface glycoprotein nb that is unique to flu b. icv and idv consist of only seven gene segments each, and they do not encode envelope glycoproteins ha and na. instead, they carry only one glycoprotein, hef (haemagglutinin-esterase fusion), which combines the functions of ha and na  .m2, pb1-f2, and nb proteins are classified as viroporins, i.e., virus-encoded short polypeptides (approximately 60-120 amino acids) that have one, two, or even three  transmembrane (tm) α-helical domains. these polypeptides form oligomers of typically four to six monomers that permeabilize membranes to ions    .am2 and bm2the rna segment 7 from iav encodes both the m1 protein and am2 proton channel via alternative splicing  26] . am2 is 97-residues long and forms a channel assembled by the tetramerization of four left-handed tm helices stabilized by disulfide bridges  27] . the am2 monomer consists of an n-terminal ectodomain (residues 1-24), an α-helical (tm) domain (residues 25-46), and a c-terminal cytoplasmic tail (ct) domain (residues 47-97) that contains a highly conserved amphipathic helix (aph) (residues 51-59)  28] .am2 forms an acid-activated proton channel with an asymmetrical preference of proton conduction from the viral exterior (n-terminus) to the interior (c-terminus). the proton channel activity of am2 is essential for two important roles. upon viral entry into cells via sialic acid-containing receptor-mediated endocytosis, the low ph (5 to 6) of late endosomes activates the proton channel activity of am2, which acidifies the viral interior  with subsequent detachment of m1 from the vrnp complex. this enables trafficking of vrnps into the host cell nucleus for synthesis of mrna and vrna  30] . the channel activity of m2 is also crucial during viral maturation, where it equilibrates the ph across the trans-golgi membrane to prevent the viral ha from undergoing premature conformational change while being transported to the plasma membrane of infected cells     . conductance and inhibition studies have used the transmembrane domain of am2 (am2-tm), since in xenopus oocytes am2(21-51) has retained the proton selectivity and drug sensitivity observed in full-length am2 protein  .four main features characterize am2-facilitated membrane permeabilization to protons: acid activation, proton selectivity, relative low proton conductance, and unidirectionality. these features are encoded in key pore-lining residues of the am2 channel. am2 has a conserved hxxxw functional motif in its tm domain (figure 1) , where his37 is responsible for proton selectivity and acid activation  , and trp41 ensures asymmetric proton conduction from the n-terminus to the c-terminus  . other residues surrounding this motif also contribute to the dynamics and proton transfer equilibria in the channel.","Janet To, Jaume Torres"

9497,Feed additives decrease survival of delta coronavirus in nursery pig diets,"abstractbackground: feed contaminated with feces from infected pigs is believed to be a potential route of transmission of porcine delta coronavirus (pdcov). the objective of this study was to determine if the addition of commercial feed additives (e.i., acids, salt and sugar) to swine feed can be an effective strategy to inactive pdcov. results: six commercial feed acids (ultraacid p, activate da, kemgest, acid booster, luprosil, and amasil), salt, and sugar were evaluated. the acids were added at the recommended concentrations to 5 g aliquots of complete feed, which were also inoculated with 1 ml of pdcov and incubated for 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days. in another experiment, double the recommended concentrations of these additives were also added to the feed samples and incubated for 0, 1, 3, 7, and 10 days. all samples were stored at room temperature (~25°c) followed by removal of aliquots at 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days. any surviving virus was eluted in a buffer solution and then titrated in swine testicular cells. feed samples without any additive were used as controls. both weibull and log-linear kinetic models were used to analyze virus survival curves. the presence of a tail in the virus inactivation curves indicated deviations from the linear behavior and hence, the weibull model was chosen for characterizing the inactivation responses due to the better fit. at recommended concentrations, delta values (days to decrease virus concentration by 1 log) ranged from 0.62-1.72 days, but there were no differences on virus survival among feed samples with or without additives at the manufacturers recommended concentrations. doubling the concentration of the additives reduced the delta value to ≤ 0.28 days (p < 0.05) for all the additives except for amasil (delta values of 0.86 vs. 4.95 days). feed additives that contained phosphoric acid, citric acid, or fumaric acid were the most effective in reducing virus survival, although none of the additives completely inactivated the virus by 10-days post-inoculation. conclusions: commercial feed additives (acidifiers and salt) may be utilized as a strategy to decrease risk of pdcov in feed, specially, commercial feed acidifiers at double the recommended concentrations reduced pdcov survival in complete feed during storage at room temperature. however, none of these additives completely inactivated the virus.","Katie M Cottingim, Harsha Verma, Pedro E Urriola, Fernando Sampedro, Gerald C Shurson, Sagar M Goyal"
4869,Automated cell-based luminescence assay for profiling antiviral compound activity against enteroviruses,"abstractwe describe the development, optimisation, and validation of an automated, cell-based and highthroughput screening assay using existing luminescence-based atplite reagents for identifying antiviral compounds that inhibit enterovirus replication. antiviral efficacy was determined by measuring the atp levels in cells that were protected from the viral cytopathic effect (cpe) by the antiviral compounds pleconaril and rupintrivir. cpe-based assay conditions were optimised at a cell density of 5000 cells/well and a viral infection dose of 100 ccid 50 in 384-well plates. the assay exhibited excellent robustness, with z′-factor values between 0.75 and 0.82, coefficients of variation between 0.33% and 1.45%, and signal-to-background ratios ranging from 6.92 to 22.6 when testing three enterovirus a71 isolates circulating in china. the assay was also suitable for screening other picornaviruses, such as poliovirus, coxsackievirus, echovirus, and parechovirus.enteroviruses (evs; genus enterovirus, family picornaviridae) are small positive-sense rna viruses that include human enteroviruses, which comprise more than 100 serotypes and are among the most common pathogens that infect humans worldwide, especially children 1 . most ev infections are asymptomatic, but some may lead to illnesses, ranging from mild to more severe, or even life-threatening, such as hand, foot, and mouth disease (hfmd), aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, pancreatitis, acute flaccid paralysis, and neonatal sepsis 1 . in recent years, outbreaks of hfmd caused by enterovirus a71 (ev-a71) or coxsackievirus a16 have occcured in china and several countries in southeast asia 2-6 . to date, there are no approved specific antiviral therapies available to treat diseases caused by evs. thus, there is an urgent need to identify safe and broad-spectrum drugs against existing pathogenic evs.we selected two well-studied compounds with different viral targets, to aid in the assay optimisation. pleconaril is an enteroviral capsid inhibitor that inhibits enterovirus replication by blocking virus uncoating and release of viral rna into cells 7,8 . pleconaril was recently reported to have anti-enterovirus efficacy in the treatment of neonatal sepsis 9-11 . rupintrivir (also known as ag-7088) is an irreversible inhibitor of the picornaviral 3 c protease, with demonstrated activity against rhinoviruses and several evs 12-14 .to measure cell viability, viral cytopathic effect (cpe) inhibition assays use uptake reagents, such as neutral red, mtt (3--dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide), or crystal violet 15 . limitations of these colorimetric assays include low throughput, requirement for washing steps, low dynamic range, and low signal-to-noise ratio. cell debris that remains from infected cells can adhere to the microplate, which can result in high background and low signal-to-noise 15 . to overcome these disadvantages, we implemented an alternative assay format using an adenosine triphosphate (atp) luminescence readout previously developed and validated for a panel of positive-strand rna viruses 15 . the atplite luminescence assay has been used to measure intracellular atp as a function of cell number and/or viability 16, 17 . the advantages of these types of assays are their homogeneous nature, their ability to use both adherent or non-adherent cell lines, and amenability to automation and high-throughput screening (hts). our experiments sought to confirm this.","Mingyu Zhang, Yong Zhang, Yan Wang, Wanyu Lv, Yanyang Zhang"

4932,"DEAD-Box Helicases: Sensors, Regulators, and Effectors for Antiviral Defense","abstractdead-box helicases are a large family of conserved rna-binding proteins that belong to the broader group of cellular dexd/h helicases. members of the dead-box helicase family have roles throughout cellular rna metabolism from biogenesis to decay. moreover, there is emerging evidence that cellular rna helicases, including dead-box helicases, play roles in the recognition of foreign nucleic acids and the modulation of viral infection. as intracellular parasites, viruses must evade detection by innate immune sensing mechanisms and degradation by cellular machinery while also manipulating host cell processes to facilitate replication. the ability of dead-box helicases to recognize rna in a sequence-independent manner, as well as the breadth of cellular functions carried out by members of this family, lead them to influence innate recognition and viral infections in multiple ways. indeed, dead-box helicases have been shown to contribute to intracellular immune sensing, act as antiviral effectors, and even to be coopted by viruses to promote their replication. however, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these interactions, as well as the cellular roles of dead-box helicases themselves, is limited in many cases. we will discuss the diverse roles that members of the dead-box helicase family play during viral infections.viruses 2020, 12, 181 2 of 15 helicases to particular rnas or proteins; the diversity of these regions accounts for the breadth of function observed within this protein family  . as a result of their diversity of binding and function, dead-box rna helicases are involved in all aspects of cellular rna metabolism, including transcription, splicing, microrna biogenesis, ribosomal rna processing, rna export, translation, rnp granule formation, and decay  . moreover, they are also involved in cellular stress responses, contributing to double-strand break (dsb) repair  , stress granule formation, and antimicrobial responses  .innate immune defenses depend upon the recognition of invading pathogens by the host, and viral infections, including rna viruses, are largely sensed through nucleic acid recognition. rna viruses present a host cell with various foreign rna features, such as unique ends, structured rna elements, or dsrna replication intermediates, which can be recognized as hallmarks of infection. rna binding proteins thus play important roles in the sensing of viral infection, and dexd/h helicases are well-suited to recognize structural features characteristic of viral rnas.the canonical cytoplasmic sensors of viral rna, the rig-i-like receptors (rlrs) rig-i and mda-5, contain dexd/h-box helicase domains  . rig-i recognizes uncapped viral rnasand short dsrnas containing a 5 triphosphate, while mda-5 binds longer dsrna replication intermediates    . in addition to the helicase core domain, these proteins contain caspase activation and recruitment domains (cards).rna recognition by these rlrs leads to oligomerization of cards and activation of antiviral signaling complexes  17] . rig-i and mda5 both signal through the card-domain-containing adapter protein mavs, causing the polymerization and activation of mavs on the mitochondrial membrane  . this leads to the activation of irf3 and irf7, promoting the transcription of . type i interferons subsequently induce the transcription of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (isgs) that control infection, including a number of rna helicases (figure 1) .dead-box helicases have been shown to contribute to cytosolic viral rna recognition and to feed into these canonical immune signaling pathways, sometimes acting in concert with deah-box helicases. several dead-box helicases promote interferon induction or other inflammatory signaling. ddx1 contributes to ifn-β activation during transmissible gastroenteritis virus infection via its interaction with the nonstructural protein nsp14  and interacts with rela potentiating nf-κb-dependent transcription, a function which requires intact helicase activity  . ddx21 is antiviral against dengue virus, promoting ifn-β induction during infection; in turn, the dengue virus ns2b/3 protein complex directs the proteasomal degradation of ddx21 to counteract this signaling  . a complex of the helicases ddx1, ddx21, and dhx36 interacts with the adaptor protein trif and cytosolic dsrna, leading to a tlr3-independent activation of irf3/7 and interferon induction, thus suggesting an additional role for trif beyond its known functions in toll-like receptor (tlr) signaling and endosomal sensing  . ddx21 has been further implicated in inflammatory signaling via the production of endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns (damps). during influenza virus infection, ddx21 and trif are required for the secretion of the tlr damp ligand s100a9, which serves as a damp signal and results in the rapid production of inflammatory cytokines, including tnf and il-6 .cytosolic dna recognition represents another important surveillance mechanism for stimulating innate immune pathways in response to invasion by dna viruses and bacteria, as the cytoplasm has a dearth of dna under normal conditions. much of this signaling is now known to occur via the cgas-sting pathway, where dna recognition by cgas leads to the production of the cyclic dinucleotide cgamp, which signals through sting, leading to phosphorylation of irf3 by tbk1  24] . however, dead-box helicases can also contribute to dsdna sensing: ddx41 senses dsdna from diverse intracellular pathogens, including bacteria and dna viruses, and upregulates interferon and cytokine responses  . ddx41 has been shown to bind dna via the walker a and b motifs of its helicase domain, to interact with sting, and to be required for the activation of tbk1  .","Frances Taschuk, Sara Cherry"

7487,Necrotizing pneumonia: an emerging problem in children?,"abstractbackground: in children, necrotizing pneumonia (np) is an uncommon, severe complication of pneumonia. it is characterized by destruction of the underlying lung parenchyma resulting in multiple small, thin-walled cavities and is often accompanied by empyema and bronchopleural fistulae. review: np in children was first reported in children in 1994, and since then there has been a gradual increase in cases, which is partially explained by greater physician awareness and use of contrast computed tomography (ct) scans, and by temporal changes in circulating respiratory pathogens and antibiotic prescribing. the most common pathogens detected in children with np are pneumococci and staphylococcus aureus. the underlying disease mechanisms are poorly understood, but likely relate to multiple host susceptibility and bacterial virulence factors, with viral-bacterial interactions also possibly having a role. most cases are in previously healthy young children who, despite adequate antibiotic therapy for bacterial pneumonia, remain febrile and unwell. many also have evidence of pleural effusion, empyema, or pyopneumothorax, which has undergone drainage or surgical intervention without clinical improvement. the diagnosis is generally made by chest imaging, with ct scans being the most sensitive, showing loss of normal pulmonary architecture, decreased parenchymal enhancement and multiple thin-walled cavities. blood culture and culture and molecular testing of pleural fluid provide a microbiologic diagnosis in as many as 50% of cases. prolonged antibiotics, draining pleural fluid and gas that causes mass effects, and maintaining ventilation, circulation, nutrition, fluid, and electrolyte balance are critical components of therapy. despite its serious nature, death is uncommon, with good clinical, radiographic and functional recovery achieved in the 5-6 months following diagnosis. increased knowledge of np's pathogenesis will assist more rapid diagnosis and improve treatment and, ultimately, prevention. conclusion: it is important to consider that our understanding of np is limited to individual case reports or small case series, and treatment data from randomized-controlled trials are lacking. furthermore, case series are retrospective and usually confined to single centers. consequently, these studies may not be representative of patients in other locations, especially when allowing for temporal changes in pathogen behaviour and differences in immunization schedules and antibiotic prescribing practices.","I Brent Masters, Alan F Isles, Keith Grimwood"

11738,molecules Aptamers Chemistry: Chemical Modifications and Conjugation Strategies,"abstractsoon after they were first described in 1990, aptamers were largely recognized as a new class of biological ligands that can rival antibodies in various analytical, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications. aptamers are short single-stranded rna or dna oligonucleotides capable of folding into complex 3d structures, enabling them to bind to a large variety of targets ranging from small ions to an entire organism. their high binding specificity and affinity make them comparable to antibodies, but they are superior regarding a longer shelf life, simple production and chemical modification, in addition to low toxicity and immunogenicity. in the past three decades, aptamers have been used in a plethora of therapeutics and drug delivery systems that involve innovative delivery mechanisms and carrying various types of drug cargos. however, the successful translation of aptamer research from bench to bedside has been challenged by several limitations that slow down the realization of promising aptamer applications as therapeutics at the clinical level. the main limitations include the susceptibility to degradation by nucleases, fast renal clearance, low thermal stability, and the limited functional group diversity. the solution to overcome such limitations lies in the chemistry of aptamers. the current review will focus on the recent arts of aptamer chemistry that have been evolved to refine the pharmacological properties of aptamers. moreover, this review will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of such chemical modifications and how they impact the pharmacological properties of aptamers. finally, this review will summarize the conjugation strategies of aptamers to nanocarriers for developing targeted drug delivery systems. molecules 2020, 25, 3 2 of 51 molecules . nowadays, the aptamer field covers various biomedical applications, including , therapeutic -6], aptasensors , biosensors  9] , diagnostic  11] , and imaging systems  .aptamers need to be stabilized for in vivo use against nuclease degradation, and their small size makes them susceptible to renal filtration. aptamers' stabilization can be attained by chemically modifying them using different approaches. moreover, introducing chemical modifications into nucleic acid libraries increases the interaction capabilities of aptamers and thereby their target spectrum  . modified aptamers may show improved chemical diversity relative to aptamers composed entirely of natural dna or rna nucleotides and expand their applications in diagnostics, therapeutics, and nanotechnology  .chemical modifications of aptamer oligonucleotides are needed mainly to enhance their resistance to nuclease degradation and lowering their renal filtration. additionally, chemical modifications, in some cases, may increase the aptamer-binding affinity  . many approaches have been introduced to promote the stability of aptamers without altering their binding affinity and specificity against their targets. these approaches include chemical modification of the phosphate backbone  15] , oxygen replacement with sulfur on the ribose unit and into phosphodiester linkage, end capping at the 3 and/or 5 terminals  17] , locked nucleic acids  19] , and circular , multivalent, and dimerization of aptamers  22] . modification of the 2 -position of the ribose sugar is the most common  24] .other aptamer chemical modification strategies were also required for conjugating aptamers to different drug molecules  or for active targeting nanoparticles  . these strategies, usually, introduce an active functionality either at the 3 or 5 terminals of the oligonucleotide to interact with their coupling partner on the surface of nanoparticles. several coupling chemistry methods have been applied for aptamer conjugation, including thiol-maleimide , carbodiimide , oxidative coupling , thiol-gold coordination , avidin-biotin coupling , and click chemistry .","Fadwa Odeh, Hamdi Nsairat, Walhan Alshaer, Mohammad A Ismail, Ezaldeen Esawi, Baraa Qaqish, Abeer Al Bawab, Said I Ismail, Jo , A A B , M A I "
9063,medicines The Current Status of the Pharmaceutical Potential of Juniperus L. Metabolites,"abstractbackground: plants and their derived natural compounds possess various biological and therapeutic properties, which turns them into an increasing topic of interest and research. juniperus genus is diverse in species, with several traditional medicines reported, and rich in natural compounds with potential for development of new drugs. methods: the research for this review were based in the scopus and web of science databases using terms combining juniperus, secondary metabolites names, and biological activities. this is not an exhaustive review of juniperus compounds with biological activities, but rather a critical selection taking into account the following criteria: (i) studies involving the most recent methodologies for quantitative evaluation of biological activities; and (ii) the compounds with the highest number of studies published in the last four years. results: from juniperus species, several diterpenes, flavonoids, and one lignan were emphasized taking into account their level of activity against several targets. antitumor activity is by far the most studied, being followed by antibacterial and antiviral activities. deoxypodophyllotoxin and one dehydroabietic acid derivative appears to be the most promising lead compounds. conclusions: this review demonstrates the juniperus species value as a source of secondary metabolites with relevant pharmaceutical potential.medicines 2018, 5, 81 2 of 24 berries are consumed to lower blood glucose levels  , while in mexico, juniperus communis l. is used to treat respiratory problems, gastrointestinal infections, cardiovascular and/or blood disorders, and as astringent  . use of j. communis also covers the treatment of urinary problems, migraines, diabetes, gonorrhea, and skin irritations  .the extracts and secondary metabolites from juniperus species exhibit also interesting bioactivities  13] , especially the juniperus oxycedrus l. and j. communis, two of the most studied species in terms of their phytochemistry, pharmacological, and therapeutic effects  15] . it can be highlighted that extracts and compounds from both plants exhibit antimicrobial, antioxidant, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, analgesic, and cytotoxic activities  15] , and additionally j. communis also possess antifertility, hepatoprotective, diuretic, neuroprotective, antiparasitic, and anti-ulcer properties  .some of the most relevant studies published in recent years on the bioactivities of juniperus extracts show clearly that juniperus continues to be a hot spot in research on natural products as well as contribute to further highlight the pharmacological potential of this genus and of its chemical constituents. for example, jung et al.  reports the butyrylcholinesterase (bche) inhibitory activity of the compound valenc-1(10), 3(4), 11(12)-trien-2-one isolated from juniperus chinensis l. with an ic 50 value of 68.45 µm (ic 50 = 18.75 µm for berberine). in lee and colleagues work , juniperus rigida siebold & zucc. fruit ethanol extract was showed to possess anti-atopic properties in in vivo oxazoloneand 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene(dncb), and induced atopic dermatitis in mice models. it was suggested that the therapeutic effect verified by this extract occurs by decreasing the overproduction of interleukin 4 (il-4) and immunoglobulin e (ige) and accelerating skin barrier recovery function. groshi et al.  assessed the cytotoxicity of the polar extract (methanol), and non-polar extracts (dichloromethane and n-hexane) of juniperus phoenicea l. leaves against four human cancer cell lines concluding that the dichloromethane extract was the most cytotoxic extract against the lung carcinoma cell line a549 (ic 50 = 13 µg/ml), while n-hexane extract exhibits the broadest spectrum of activity with ic 50 values of 10, 14, 16, and 40 µg/ml against hepatocellular carcinoma cell line hepg2, human breast cancer cell line mcf-7, human lung carcinoma a549, and human bladder carcinoma cell line ej138, respectively. on the other hand, imbricataloic acid isolated from juniperus phoenicea var. turbinata (guss.) parl. (syn. juniperus turbinata guss.) ethanol extract showed the strongest cytotoxic activity (ic 50 values of 0.06, 0.114, and 0.201 µm on human colon cancer hct116, human malignant melanoma a375, and human breast adenocarcinoma mda-mb-231 cell lines, respectively), being several times more potent than the reference compound cisplatin (ic 50 values of 1.87 to 11.86 µm)  indicating that imbricataloic acid make a promising anticancer drug candidate.the essential oil of juniperus species are also a research target once they exhibit a great diversity of bioactivities. for example, the essential oil of j. phoenicea var. turbinata (syn. juniperus turbinata guss.) exhibits cytotoxic effects against hct116, a375, and mda-mb-231 human tumor cell lines, in a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect with ic 50 values of 9.48-33.69 µg/ml  . juniperus oxycedrus essential oil exhibited high antitrypanosomal activity (ic 50 of 0.9 µg/ml) against trypanosoma brucei brucei, with no cytotoxic effects on raw 267.4 macrophage cell line showing the highest selectivity index (63.4)  . the authors of this study suggest that α-pinene would likely be the responsible for the j. oxycedrus essential oil antitrypanosomal properties. in another work using male mice  , juniperus virginiana l. essential oil at 400 and 800 mg/kg showed anxiolytic effect, although it failed to inhibit the anxiety-related behavior by light-dark box.the interest of the juniperus species is also at the nutritional/functional food level and some studies, including in vivo studies on this subject, have recently been published. inci and colleagues  found that low supplementation levels of j. communis berry (0.5% and 1%) in japanese quails (coturnix coturnix japonica) diets have positive impacts on some body qualities, feed intake, and live weight. juniperus species are also valuable in terms of their wood since it is a viable construction material classified as durable or even very durable, like j. communis case  . in this context, ateş et al.  suggest that juniperus foetidissima willd. could be aimed for new natural","Wilson R Tavares, Ana M L Seca"

11256,Inhibitory effects of magnolol and honokiol on human calcitonin aggregation OPEN,"abstractamyloid formation is associated with multiple amyloidosis diseases. human calcitonin (hct) is a typical amyloidogenic peptide, its aggregation is associated with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (mtc), and also limits its clinical application. magnolia officinalis is a traditional chinese herbal medicine; its two major polyphenol components, magnolol (mag) and honokiol (hon), have displayed multiple functions. polyphenols like flavonoids and their derivatives have been extensively studied as amyloid inhibitors. however, the anti-amyloidogenic property of a biphenyl backbone containing polyphenols such as mag and hon has not been reported. in this study, these two compounds were tested for their effects on hct aggregation. we found that mag and hon both inhibited the amyloid formation of hct, whereas mag showed a stronger inhibitory effect; moreover, they both dose-dependently disassembled preformed hct aggregates. further immuno-dot blot and dynamic light scattering studies suggested mag and hon suppressed the aggregation of hct both at the oligomerization and the fibrillation stages, while mtt-based and dye-leakage assays demonstrated that mag and hon effectively reduced cytotoxicity caused by hct aggregates. furthermore, isothermal titration calorimetry indicated mag and hon both interact with hct. together, our study suggested a potential anti-amyloidogenic property of these two compounds and their structure related derivatives.amyloidogenic proteins are capable of misfolding and assembling into amyloid deposits which are considered to be important causative factors of amyloid diseases such as alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus 1-3 . in pathological situations, amyloidogenic proteins aggregate into oligomers, followed by forming extensive linear fibrils, which is accompanied with a structural transition into β -sheet-rich structures 4-9 . studies have shown that the oligomeric intermediates are the most toxic species during amyloid aggregation 10-13 , which induce cell apoptosis mostly by penetrating the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane 14-16 . preventing amyloid proteins from aggregating into toxic conformers has thus become a strategy to prevent or treat amyloid diseases 17 .human calcitonin (hct) is a 32-residue blood calcium and bone resorption regulating peptide secreted by the c cells of the thyroid (fig. 1a) 18 . originally, hct was used to treat osteoporosis and paget's disease 19,20 , however, due to its high intrinsic tendency to aggregate and the low bioactivity as the result of aggregation, the clinical application of hct has been discontinued by fda 21,22 . moreover, amyloid deposits of hct have been discovered in patients with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (mtc), indicating an association between mtc and hct aggregation 23,24 . therefore, salmon calcitonin (sct), which has much lower aggregation propensity but only shares 50% homology to hct, is clinically used instead 25 . however, hct has a much higher potency than sct 26 , and sct administration can cause side effects like anorexia and vomiting 27,28 . inhibiting hct aggregation is thus of great importance both for pharmaceutical preparation of hct in vitro and for the treatment of mtc.great efforts have been made to identify inhibitors that suppress the aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins 17,29-33 , among which, compounds derived from herbal medicines have been extensively reported 34, 35 . magnolia officinalis is a traditional chinese herbal medicine with multiple pharmaceutical activities including eliminating damp and phlegm, relieving distension 36 , and potential anti-tumor properties 37 . two polyphenols derived from magnolia officinalis, magnolol (mag) and honokiol (hon), are its major effective ingredients, which are known to have anti-oxidation 37,38 , anti-tumor 39-41 , anti-inflammatory 42,43 and neuroprotective 44 properties. recent studies also suggested mag and hon exhibited beneficial effects on amyloid-β induced cytotoxicity 45, 46 .on the other hand, polyphenols, which have multiple aromatic phenolic rings, have been regarded as a class of potential amyloid inhibitors 47, 48 . flavonoids along with their derivatives are the most studied polyphenols, for example, (−)-epigallocatechin 3-gallate (egcg), a derivative of flavanone, has been extensively studied for its anti-amyloidogenic activity on α -synuclein 49 , sevi 50 , islet amyloid polypeptide 51 and amyloid β 52,53 , and is currently undergoing a phase ii/iii clinical study to treat alzheimer's disease 54 . other polyphenols such as curcumin, caffeic acid, have also been reported 17 . however, the anti-amyloidogenic property of polyphenols with a biphenyl backbone, such as mag and hon (fig. 1c,d) , have not been determined. here, hct was used as a model to test their anti-amyloid aggregation properties.","Caiao Guo, Liang Ma, Yudan Zhao, Anlin Peng, Biao Cheng, Qiaoqiao Zhou, Ling Zheng, Kun Huang"
7394,"Epidemiological evaluation of cat health at a first-response animal shelter in Fukushima, following the Great East Japan Earthquakes of 2011","abstractthe great east japan earthquakes of march 11, 2011 caused immense harm to the community and subsequent nuclear accident in fukushima prefecture extended the damage. local residents were forced to evacuated without pets and the left behind animals were rescued from the restricted zone one month later. unplanned animal rescue and unregulated sheltering caused secondary damage to animals such as disease epidemics at impounded animal shelter. the purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the incidence of upper respiratory infection (uri) and diarrhea in cats at the first response animal shelter in fukushima, and investigate factors affecting the duration of disease and determinants of treatments performed. eighty percent and 59% of impounded cats developed uri, 71% and 54% of cats developed diarrhea, and 91% and 83% of cats had at least one disease in 2011 and 2012, respectively. uses of multiple drug administration (more than five drugs) was associated with prolonged uri and diarrhea. multiple antibiotics, antihistamines, interferon, and steroids were associated with relapse of and prolonged uri. developing a standardized treatment protocol for commonly observed diseases at japanese animal shelters to prevent and control diseases, to promote animal welfare, and protect public health in the face of future disasters is overdue. did not allow animals, so dogs and cats accompanying owners were either brought to the ihno shelter or transferred to neighboring animal hospitals. the animal rescue operation originally focused on searching for companion animals in the restricted zone, and was incepted based upon pressure from pet owners forced to abandon their pets. the consequences of abandonment included: animal starvation, emaciation, and death; illegal entry to feed or reclaim animals with resultant exposure to unsafe radiation levels; uncontrolled animal reproduction; and harm to the area's ecosystem.the animal rescue operation in fukushima took place for more than four years (and ended in december 31, 2015) due to the ongoing nuclear emergency at the power plant, while temporary animal shelters located in the disaster regions affected by the tsunami and earthquakes (miyagi prefecture) closed mostly within six months. the ihno shelter was initially established at a warehouse and was unsuitable for sheltering dogs and cats for a prolonged time; therefore, a second shelter was built in miharu, fukushima, and all animals were transferred there in january 2013. because the animal rescue operation time was lengthy, it evolved through two phases. the initial chaotic phase suffered from lack of infrastructure, resources, and competent staff, exaggerating an already stressful situation. in the first seven months of the initial phase, there were no guidelines or protocols for managing animals at the shelter, different volunteer veterinarians engaged in the care of animals each day, and infectious diseases were extremely common. the second phase was far more stable: most of the animals were tamed, socialized, and experienced a low incidence of disease.the primary health issue reported for cats at animal shelters was upper respiratory infection (uri)     . the inherent properties of animal shelters, which include a constant influx of animals without medical backgrounds or vaccination histories, overcrowding, lack of quarantine or isolation facilities, poor hygiene, loud noise, housing with dogs, confinement to cages, and extremely stressful environments, act as risk factors for endemic infectious diseases     . although the prevalence of causative agents is shelter-specific-9], the majority of uri is caused by feline herpesvirus-1 (fhv-1), feline calicivirus (fcv), bordetella bronchiseptica, chlamydophila felis, and mycoplasma species  10, 11] . apparently healthy cats can be carriers for all of these agents; this and the risk that shelters pose make control of uri extremely difficult in the absence of standardized protocols for disease prevention and management.diarrhea is also a common disease in sheltered cats; the causes are multifactorial, including stress, diet, and viral, protozoal, bacterial, or helminthic infection 12]. it also shares common risk factors with uri in shelters, including crowding, stress, poor hygiene practice, and asymptomatic shedding cats  12] . although causative agents for uri and diarrhea and risk factors for disease development are known, shelters do not necessarily have the resources to establish definitive diagnoses, and symptomatically treating cats without validated guidelines for shelter management will not necessarily resolve clinical illness or prevent the spread of infectious disease if the risk factors go uncontrolled.in this research, a retrospective epidemiological evaluation of sheltered cats was performed to investigate feline health status and treatment protocols during the first and second years at the ihno, japan shelter. the incidences of uri and diarrhea were compared between the first and second years, and related to factors predictive of disease duration and frequency, including choice of treatment options.","Aki Tanaka, Philip H Kass, Beatriz Martinez -Lopez, Shinichi Hayama"

9158,Environmental Research and Public Health Editorial Research Frontiers of Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management: What Do We Know So Far?,"abstracthealth-emergency disaster risk management (health-edrm) emerged as the latest knowledge, research and policy paradigm shift from response to preparedness and health risk management in non-emergency times  . this approach attempts to enlist and empower communities to invest and emphasize their disaster health risk reduction efforts, thereby strengthening health systems and supporting community health resilience building. this special issue has collected 20 scientific papers that attempt to examine the research frontier in health-edrm.major health-edrm research evidence gaps were found during a global research agenda setting meeting of the 2018 who health-edrm global research group in kobe. kayano, chan, murry et al.  highlighted the development need for relevant research methodologies, risk communication approaches, health data management strategies, practical health emergency study ethical guidelines, bridging global research capacity disparities, and infrastructure constraints, to ensure knowledge advancement in health-edrm. the authors also pointed out the lack of understanding of psychosocial health risk profiling in population subgroups. reifel's analysis showed a better understanding of current doctrines and practices in both clinical mental health practices and policy, which will help to bridge the conceptual interlinkages between the preventive-based disaster risk reduction policy agenda and the curative-focused disaster mental health discipline  . genereux, schluter, tamahashi et al.  argued that standardizing psychometrically robust instruments would also be urgently needed to identify at-risk patients throughout-before, during, and after emergencies and disasters-to ensure that mental and social health needs are addressed throughout the pathway of care (prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation). aung, murry and kayano  discussed the need for new research and ethical guidelines to harmonize research efforts in health-edrm and kubo, yanasan, herbosa et al.  described the challenges in the standardization of health data collection throughout the research processes.existing surveillance databases, new study tools, and innovation methodologies may help to identify population health risks and support health-edrm policy development. using a syndromic surveillance database in the philippines, salazar, law, winkler  showed how an existing clinical based database might be useful in assisting emergency health service planning decision making during outbreaks in armed conflict. even with the database limitations to report injuries and death, this existing data system was nevertheless useful to support non-communicable diseases' service caseload planning. using the computerized random digit dialling methods for rapid data collection after a major urban subway fire incident, chan, huang, hung et al.  captured health risk perception, misconceptions, and community first-aid response knowledge in urban man-made emergency incidents. using social media data from twitter, gruebner, lowe, sykora et al.  showed how the spatio-temporal distribution of int.","Emily Ying, Yang Chan, Holly Ching, Yu Lam"
9482,The Impact of Infection on Population Health: Results of the Ontario Burden of Infectious Diseases Study,"abstractbackground: evidence-based priority setting is increasingly important for rationally distributing scarce health resources and for guiding future health research. we sought to quantify the contribution of a wide range of infectious diseases to the overall infectious disease burden in a high-income setting.methodology/principal findings: we used health-adjusted life years (halys), a composite measure comprising premature mortality and reduced functioning due to disease, to estimate the burden of 51 infectious diseases and associated syndromes in ontario using 2005-2007 data. deaths were estimated from vital statistics data and disease incidence was estimated from reportable disease, healthcare utilization, and cancer registry data, supplemented by local modeling studies and national and international epidemiologic studies. the 51 infectious agents and associated syndromes accounted for 729 lost halys, 44.2 deaths, and 58,987 incident cases per 100,000 population annually. the most burdensome infectious agents were: hepatitis c virus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, human papillomavirus, hepatitis b virus, human immunodeficiency virus, staphylococcus aureus, influenza virus, clostridium difficile, and rhinovirus. the top five, ten, and 20 pathogens accounted for 46%, 67%, and 75% of the total infectious disease burden, respectively. marked sex-specific differences in disease burden were observed for some pathogens. the main limitations of this study were the exclusion of certain infectious diseases due to data availability issues, not considering the impact of co-infections and co-morbidity, and the inability to assess the burden of milder infections that do not result in healthcare utilization.conclusions/significance: infectious diseases continue to cause a substantial health burden in high-income settings such as ontario. most of this burden is attributable to a relatively small number of infectious agents, for which many effective interventions have been previously identified. therefore, these findings should be used to guide public health policy, planning, and research.","Jeffrey C Kwong, Sujitha Ratnasingham, Michael A Campitelli, Nick Daneman, Shelley L Deeks, Douglas G Manuel, Vanessa G Allen, Ahmed M Bayoumi, Aamir Fazil, David N Fisman, Andrea S Gershon, Effie Gournis, E Jenny Heathcote, Frances B Jamieson, Prabhat Jha, Kamran M Khan, Shannon E Majowicz, Tony Mazzulli, Allison J Mcgeer, Matthew P Muller, Abhishek Raut, Elizabeth Rea, Robert S Remis, Rita Shahin, Alissa J Wright, Brandon Zagorski, Natasha S Crowcroft"
5405,viruses Ebola Virus Entry: From Molecular Characterization to Drug Discovery,"abstractebola virus disease (evd) is one of the most lethal transmissible infections, characterized by a high fatality rate, and caused by a member of the filoviridae family. the recent large outbreak of evd in western africa (2013)(2014)(2015)(2016) highlighted the worldwide threat represented by the disease and its impact on global public health and the economy. the development of highly needed anti-ebola virus antivirals has been so far hampered by the shortage of tools to study their life cycle in vitro, allowing to screen for potential active compounds outside a biosafety level-4 (bsl-4) containment. importantly, the development of surrogate models to study ebola virus entry in a bsl-2 setting, such as viral pseudotypes and ebola virus-like particles, tremendously boosted both our knowledge of the viral life cycle and the identification of promising antiviral compounds interfering with viral entry. in this context, the combination of such surrogate systems with large-scale small molecule compounds and haploid genetic screenings, as well as rational drug design and drug repurposing approaches will prove priceless in our quest for the development of a treatment for evd.until 2014, evd was considered a neglected disease, causing small outbreaks in remote african villages. ebov research was focused mainly on biology aspects of viral infection or preparedness due to its potential use as bioweapon, and was limited to few laboratories equipped with biosafety level-4 (bsl-4) facilities. however, the recent large outbreak of evd (western africa, 2013-2016) characterized by 28,616 cases and 11,310 deaths, highlighted the worldwide danger of this disease and its impact on global public health and economy  .thus, research on the molecular dissection of ebov life cycle received a strong stimulus and financial support with the ultimate goal of developing effective preventive and therapeutic approaches. in this review, we summarize the current knowledge of a specific step of the ebov life cycle, the entry process, and the compounds identified so far capable of interfering with it, as well as the molecular models used to these purposes.ebov is an enveloped, negative-stranded rna virus characterized by a virion of ≈80 nm of diameter and a length ranging from hundreds of nanometers to micrometers. the genome encodes for seven structural proteins: the nucleoprotein (n), the virion protein (vp) 24, vp35, vp30, vp40, the glycoprotein (gp), and the rna-dependent rna polymerase (l) . inside the viral particle, the ribonucleoprotein complex consists of the genomic rna encapsidated by n, which binds to vp35, vp30 and l. the ribonucleoprotein complex interacts with the envelope, containing the gp, through the matrix protein vp40 and the minor matrix protein vp24. viral tropism is determined by gp that allows the interaction with target cells. ebov productively infects a broad range of cell types such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, hepatocytes, and adrenal cortical cells  . following host cell attachment (figure 1) , the virus is internalized by macropinocytosis, a non-selective process of engulfment    . binding to target cells is mediated by different attaching factors, i.e., c-type lectins, t-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1, and tyrosine kinase receptor axl              . furthermore, it has been shown that binding efficiency is related to the activity of acid sphingomyelinase (asmase) and to the presence of plasma membrane sphingomyelin  . on the viral side, ebov attachment and entry are mediated by the surface glycoprotein gp, a class i fusion protein. in its native state, gp is a triplet of heterodimers, each composed of a receptor binding subunit (gp1) and a fusion subunit (gp2). the gp1 and gp2 subunits originate by the cleavage within the golgi complex of a single precursor peptide, and remain associated through a disulfide bond and non-covalent interactions  24] . after initial internalization (figure 1), virus particle trafficking into the endo-lysosomal pathway ends up into late endosomes, where the low-ph-dependent cysteine proteases cathepsins b and l process gp1 into a 19 kda fusogenic form  23,     , exposing the putative receptor binding domain  . subsequently, the interaction between the processed gp1 and the late endosomal/lysosomal protein neimann-pick c1 (npc-1) leads to gp2-dependent fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal limiting membrane    . furthermore, it has been shown that the fusion step also requires the two-pore channel 2 (tpc2) activity  , although the specific role of tpc2 in viral entry is not entirely clear yet  . finally, the viral nucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm leading to transcription and replication of the viral genome, followed by assembly and budding of the viral progeny  . after the infection of primary cell targets, the viral progeny spreads to a variety of cell types and tissues, eventually resulting into a generalized organ failure .","Cristiano Salata, Arianna

3501,Porcine parvovirus infection activates mitochondria-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway by inducing ROS accumulation,"abstractbackground: porcine parvovirus (ppv) infection primarily causes reproductive failure of pregnant swine and results in host cell death. boars, as an important disseminator, shed ppv to sows via semen. ppv infects and numerously replicates in boar testicle, which results in damage of swine testicle in vivo. reactive oxygen species (ros), a mediator of cell apoptosis, play a crucial role in the mitochondria apoptotic pathway. however, whether ppv infection induces st cells apoptosis and ros accumulation is still unclear. methods: to determine the effects of ppv infection on the apoptosis, we detected morphological changes, dna ladder, activities of caspases, and expression of parp in ppv-infected st cells. moreover, aiming to investigate the effect of ppv infection on the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and ros accumulation, we detected the δψm, apoptosis-related genes, and ros. to investigate the role of ros in the process of ppv-induced apoptosis, the st cells were infected with ppv and treated with the ros antioxidants. the ros level was measured using reactive oxygen species assay kit and the δψm, expression level of bcl-2, translocation of bax, and redistribution of mitochondria cytochrome c were tested.in this study, we demonstrated that ppv infection could induce apoptosis that was characterized by morphological changes, dna fragmentation and activation of caspases. moreover, ppv infection suppressed bcl-2 expression, enhanced bax expression and translocation to mitochondria, decreased the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and triggered the release of cytochrome c, which caused the subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and initiation of apoptosis. however, during the process of ppv-induced apoptosis, the protein levels of fas and fasl were not affected. further studies showed that ppv infection caused ros accumulation. inhibition of ros could reduce mitochondrial transmembrane potential and could significantly block st cells apoptosis via suppressing bax translocation, cytochrome c and caspase-3 activation. conclusions: all these results suggest that ppv-induced ros accumulation mediates apoptosis in st cells, which provided theoretical basis for the molecular pathogenesis of ppv infection.","Xiaomin Zhao, Hailing Xiang, Xiaoyuan Bai, Naijiao Fei, Yong Huang, Xiangjun Song, Hongling Zhang, Liang Zhang, Dewen Tong"
6335,"The Origin, Dynamic Morphology, and PI4P-Independent Formation of Encephalomyocarditis Virus Replication Organelles","abstractpicornaviruses induce dramatic rearrangements of endomembranes in the cells that they infect to produce dedicated platforms for viral replication. these structures, termed replication organelles (ros), have been well characterized for the enterovirus genus of the picornaviridae. however, it is unknown whether the diverse ro morphologies associated with enterovirus infection are conserved among other picornaviruses. here, we use serial electron tomography at different stages of infection to assess the three-dimensional architecture of ros induced by encephalomyocarditis virus (emcv), a member of the cardiovirus genus of the family of picornaviruses that is distantly related. ultrastructural analyses revealed connections between early single-membrane emcv ros and the endoplasmic reticulum (er), establishing the er as a likely donor organelle for their formation. these early single-membrane ros appear to transform into double-membrane vesicles (dmvs) as infection progresses. both single-and double-membrane structures were found to support viral rna synthesis, and progeny viruses accumulated in close proximity, suggesting a spatial association between rna synthesis and virus assembly. further, we explored the role of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (pi4p), a critical host factor for both enterovirus and cardiovirus replication that has been recently found to expedite enterovirus ro formation rather than being strictly required. by exploiting an emcv escape mutant, we found that low-pi4p conditions could also be overcome for the formation of cardiovirus ros. collectively, our data show that despite differences in the membrane source, there are striking similarities in the biogenesis, morphology, and transformation of cardiovirus and enterovirus ros, which may well extend to other picornaviruses. importance like all positive-sense rna viruses, picornaviruses induce the rearrangement of host cell membranes to form unique structures, or replication organelles (ros), that support viral rna synthesis. here, we investigate the architecture and biogenesis of cardiovirus ros and compare them with those induced by enteroviruses, members of the well-characterized picornavirus genus enterovirus. the origins and dynamic morphologies of cardiovirus ros are revealed using electron tomography, which points to the endoplasmic reticulum as the donor organelle usurped to produce single-membrane tubules and vesicles that transform into double-membrane vesicles. we show that pi4p, a critical lipid for cardiovirus and enterovirus replication, is not strictly required for the formation of cardiovirus ros, as functional ros with typical morphologies are formed under phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type iii alpha (pi4ka) inhibition in cells infected with an escape mutant. our citation melia ce, van der schaar hm, de jong awm, lyoo hr, snijder ej, koster aj, van kuppeveld fjm, bárcena m. 2018. the origin, dynamic morphology, and pi4p-independent formation of encephalomyocarditis virus replication organelles. mbio 9:e00420-18.","C E Melia, H M Van Der Schaar, A W M De Jong, H R Lyoo, E J Snijder, A J Koster, F J M Van Kuppeveld, M Bárcena"
8061,Two Genetically Similar H9N2 Influenza A Viruses Show Different Pathogenicity in Mice,"abstracth9n2 avian influenza virus has repeatedly infected humans and other mammals, which highlights the need to determine the pathogenicity and the corresponding mechanism of this virus for mammals. in this study, we found two h9n2 viruses with similar genetic background but with different pathogenicity in mice. the a/duck/nanjing/06/2003 (nj06) virus was highly pathogenic for mice, with a 50% mouse lethal dose (mld 50 ) of 10 2.83 50% egg infectious dose (eid 50 ), whereas the a/duck/nanjing/01/1999 (nj01) virus was low pathogenic for mice, with a mld 6.81 50 of >10 eid 50 . further studies showed that the nj06 virus grew faster and reached significantly higher titers than nj01 in vivo and in vitro. moreover, the nj06 virus induced more severe lung lesions, and higher levels of inflammatory cellular infiltration and cytokine response in lungs than nj01 did. however, only 12 different amino acid residues (ha-k157e, na-a9t, na-r435k, pb2-t149p, pb2-k627e, pb1-r187k, pa-l548m, pa-m550l, np-g127e, np-p277h, np-d340n, ns1-d171n) were found between the two viruses, and all these residues except for na-r435k were located in the known functional regions involved in interaction of viral proteins or between the virus and host factors. summary, our results suggest that multiple amino acid differences may be responsible for the higher pathogenicity of the nj06 virus for mice, resulting in lethal infection, enhanced viral replication, severe lung lesions, and excessive inflammatory cellular infiltration and cytokine response in lungs. these observations will be helpful for better understanding the pathogenic potential and the corresponding molecular basis of h9n2 viruses that might pose threats to human health in the future.","Akio Adachi, Benjamin Roche, Mariette Ducatez, Yin Li, Liu Q Liu, Y , Yang J , Huang X , Han K , Zhao D , Bi K , Li Y , Qingtao Liu, Yuzhuo Liu, Jing Yang, Xinmei Huang, Kaikai Han, Dongmin Zhao, Keran Bi"

1401,Correspondence to,"abstractasthma is a common disorder of the airways characterized by airway inflammation and by decline in lung function and airway remodeling in a subset of asthmatics. airway remodeling is characterized by structural changes which include airway smooth muscle hypertrophy/ hyperplasia, subepithelial fibrosis due to thickening of the reticular basement membrane, mucus metaplasia of the epithelium, and angiogenesis. epidemiologic studies suggest that both genetic and environmental factors may contribute to decline in lung function and airway remodeling in a subset of asthmatics. environmental factors include respiratory viral infection-triggered asthma exacerbations, and tobacco smoke. there is also evidence that several asthma candidate genes may contribute to decline in lung function, including adam33, plaur, vegf, il13, chi3l1, tslp, gsdmb, tgfb1, postn, esr1 and arg2. in addition, mediators or cytokines, including cysteinyl leukotrienes, matrix metallopeptidase-9, interleukin-33 and eosinophil expression of transforming growth factor-β, may contribute to airway remodeling in asthma. although increased airway smooth muscle is associated with reduced lung function (i.e. forced expiratory volume in 1 second) in asthma, there have been few long-term studies to determine how individual pathologic features of airway remodeling contribute to decline in lung function in asthma. clinical studies with inhibitors of individual gene products, cytokines or mediators are needed in asthmatic patients to identify their individual role in decline in lung function and/or airway remodeling.",David H Broide
10804,"Pulmonary melanoma and ""crazy paving"" patterns in chest images: a case report and literature review","abstractbackground: in the lung, melanoma is mostly arranged as patterns of multiple nodules, solitary nodules, or miliary invasions. very rarely, it also displays a ""crazy paving"" pattern (also described as a ""paving stone,"" ""flagstone,"" or ""slabstone"" pattern), which is rarer still in discrete bilateral nodules. this pattern is considered to be caused by pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, but its association with various diseases is unclear. case presentation: a 60-year-old man was diagnosed with pulmonary melanoma. computed tomography revealed discrete bilateral nodules surrounded by a ""paving"" pattern. a literature review found more than 40 types of diseases that have presented with ""paving"" patterns in the lung-predominantly pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, viral pneumonia, exogenous lipoid pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis, interstitial pneumonia, ards, squalene aspiration pneumonia, radiation pneumonitis, drug-induced pneumonitis, pulmonary leptospirosis, pulmonary hemorrhage, and pulmonary nocardiosis. conclusions: we describe the first case of pulmonary melanoma in the form of discrete bilateral nodules accompanied with a computed tomography paving pattern. although pulmonary paving patterns are rare, more than 40 diseases reportedly display them; clinicians should consider melanoma of the lung in differential diagnoses for patients who show such a pattern.","Yikuan Feng, Jianping Zhao, Qun Yang, Weining Xiong, Guohua Zhen, Yongjian Xu, Zhenxiang Zhang, Huilan Zhang"
3948,Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) dynamics evidence immunomodulation during ISAV- Infected Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) OPEN,"abstractdespite evidence for participation in the host response to infection, the roles of many long non-coding rnas (lncrnas) remain unknown. therefore, the aims of this study were to identify lncrnas in atlantic salmon (salmo salar) and evaluate their transcriptomic regulation during isa virus (isav) infection, an orthomyxoviridae virus associated with high mortalities in salmonid aquaculture. using next-generation sequencing, whole-transcriptome analysis of the salmo salar response to isav infection was performed, identifying 5,636 putative lncrnas with a mean length of 695 base pairs. the transcriptional modulation evidenced a similar number of differentially expressed lncrnas in the gills (3,294), head-kidney (3,275), and liver (3,325) over the course of the infection. moreover, analysis of a subset of these lncrnas showed the following: (i) most were similarly regulated in response to isa virus infection; (ii) the transcript subsets were uniquely modulated in each tissue (gills, liver, and head-kidney); and (iii) a subset of lncrnas were upregulated for each tissue and time analysed, indicating potential markers for isav infection. these findings represent the first discovery of widespread differential expression of lncrnas in response to virus infection in non-model species, suggesting that lncrnas could be involved in regulating the host response during isav infection.large-scale transcriptomic studies have led to surprising discoveries, including that <10% of the mammalian genome is dedicated to protein coding and that the genome contains a vast amount of non-protein coding transcripts, which has resulted in debate about the role of non-coding rnas (ncrnas) in cell biology 1,2 . in contrast to protein coding genes, it is possible that the non-coding portion of the genome is related to organism complexity and crucial regulatory processes 3,4 . traditionally, the regulatory functions of rna were thought limited to roles as ribosomal, messenger, and transfer rnas. however, ncrnas have been classified as housekeeping rnas, micrornas, small interfering rnas, piwi-interacting rnas, small ncrnas (< 200 nucleotides nt] in length), and long ncrnas (lncrnas, > 200 nt in length) 5 .specifically, lncrnas are endogenous cellular rnas that are mrna-like in length but with an absent or reduced coding potential (open reading frames (orf) > 30 amino acids). these rnas include tens of thousands of polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated lncrnas that are anti-sense, intronic, intergenic, and that overlap with protein coding loci 5 . once thought to be transcriptional noise, lncrnas have been shown to regulate a variety of biological processes. while the complex paradigm of rna-based gene regulation is slowly being revealed, there is a growing body of evidence for a central role of lncrnas in controlling gene regulation 6,7 . a recent review estimated that the total number of lncrnas is likely ~20,000 transcripts, but, to date, only ~200 lncrnas have been characterized 8 .among the most well studied lncrnas, xist and air epigenetically silence transcription by targeting chromatin-modifying complexes of particular genes in trans and cis isomers, respectively 9,10 . other lncrnas act at the post-transcriptional level. these include h19, which is the precursor of mir-675, a moderator of cell growth 11 ; and malat1, which forms a molecular scaffold for several proteins present in nuclear speckles and which regulates pre-mrna alternative splicing 12 .although infection and disease are major driving forces of survival and, consequently, adaptation, the potential roles of lncrnas during the defense response remain unknown. since the functions of lncrnas are highly pleiotropic, ranging from gene regulation and small ncrna precursor development 13 to cell development and cancer growth 14,15 , lncrnas are very likely involved in virus infection. early studies of the relationship between ncrnas and viruses mainly focus on micro rnas 16,17 , while the roles of lncrnas are not well studied. however, there is emerging evidence that cellular lncrna expression can be regulated by virus infection.differentiated lncrna expression occurs in response to viral infection 18, 19 . specifically, transcriptome-wide deep sequencing revealed the differential expression of more than a thousand potential lncrnas during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) infection in mice 20 , and several of these lncrnas are similarly regulated during influenza a virus (iav) infection 21 . moreover, most lncrnas show comparative regulatory responses between sars-cov and orthomyxoviridae infections, but lncrnas have kinetic type i interferon receptor and stat1 expression profiles that are distinct to each infection 22 . these findings suggest a widespread differential expression of lncrnas in response to virus infection, in addition to the involvement of lncrnas in regulating the defense response.infectious salmon anemia (isa) is a significant disease affecting farmed atlantic salmon (salmo salar l.). this disease, listed by the world organization for animal health, is caused by a negative sense, segmented, single-stranded rna virus of the orthomyxoviridae family 23 . this virus family historically consists of five genera (influenza virus a, b, and c; isavirus; and thogotovirus) that differ in their host ranges and transmission routes 24 . like other orthomyxoviridae, isav mrnas have capped, heterogeneous 5′ -ends, and, due to a need for capped host nuclear rnas as primers for mrna synthesis, synthesis is inhibited by amanitin, a specific inhibitor of cellular rna polymerase ii 25 . the outcome of isav infection is determined by a complex interaction between the virus and host, which have been characterized by three, ordered waves of gene expression that produce immediate-early, delayed-early, and late responses, as well as replication of the viral genome 26,27 . however, the molecular mechanisms and transcriptional dynamics behind the host response to isa infection are still unknown. next-generation sequencing technologies facilitate rapid and cost-effective deep transcriptome studies in non-model species. despite expanded data, surprisingly little remains known about how lncrnas function, how many different types of lncrnas exist, or even if most lncrnas are biologically significant.in the present study, we hypothesized that isav could regulate the expression of lncrnas in infected fish, thus regulating the antiviral response. to evaluate this, the transcriptomic responses of the gills, liver, and head-kidney of atlantic salmon infected with the highly virulent hpr7b-isav strain were determined through whole rna-seq profiling. the results showed a widespread differentiation of lncrnas in response to isav infection, suggesting that these transcripts are involved in regulating the host response to the virus. moreover, lncrnas accounted for approximately 5% of all expressed contig during infection. the results of this study contribute to a better understanding of isav pathogenesis and the interplay of lncrnas with the immune response in atlantic salmon.","Sebastian Boltaña, Diego Valenzuela-Miranda, Andrea Aguilar, Simon Mackenzie, Cristian Gallardo-Escárate"

7787,6-Thioguanine is a noncompetitive and slow binding inhibitor of human deubiquitinating protease USP2 OPEN,"abstractubiquitin-specific protease 2 (usp2) belongs to the family of deubiquitinases that can rescue protein targets from proteasomal degradation by reversing their ubiquitination. in various cancers, including prostate cancer and ovarian carcinoma, upregulation of usp2 leads to an increase in the levels of deubiquitinated substrates such as fatty acid synthase, mdm2, cyclin d1 and aurora-a. usp2 thus plays a critical role in tumor cells' survival and therefore represents a therapeutic target. here a leukemia drug, 6-thioguanine, was found to be a potent inhibitor of usp2. enzyme-kinetic and x-ray crystallographic data suggest that 6-thioguanine displays a noncompetitive and slow-binding inhibitory mechanism against usp2. our study provides a clear rationale for the clinical evaluation of 6-thioguanine for usp2-upregulated cancers.ubiquitination, a kind of post-translational modification, as well as deubiquitination, which together comprise the ubiquitination system, can regulate not only the turnover of cellular proteins but also, through various modes of mono-or polyubiquitination, receptor trafficking, dna repair, cell-cycle progression, immune response, autophagy and apoptosis 1 . this versatility has raised interest in pinpointing components of the ubiquitin system as prime candidates for drug targets 2 . among them, the pursuit of deubiquitinases (dubs) as pharmaceutical targets is still in its infancy in that few inhibitors have entered clinical trials, albeit some broad-spectrum inhibitors have been patented and highly selective inhibitors have been developed 3-6 . the human genome encodes about 80-90 dubs, of which the largest of the five dub families is the ubiquitin-specific proteases (usps) 7 . one of these, usp2, is able to remove ubiquitin from a range of protein substrates such as fatty acid synthase 8 , mdm2 9 , cyclin d1 10 and aurora-a 11 . fatty acid synthase has been reported to be highly expressed in a variety of cancers, including cancers of the prostate, ovary, lung, colon, and breast 12 , while mdm2, cyclin d1 and aurora-a play critical roles in p53 regulation, cell cycle progression and mitotic events, respectively 9,10,13 . all of these studies suggest that the inhibition of usp2 may be a good therapeutic approach against cancers. in 2016, davis et al. 6 reported that a small molecule, ml364, can induce cell cycle arrest and inhibit the growth of colorectal and mantle cell lymphoma cell lines via usp2 inhibition, albeit it is still not a clinical drug. in the present study, 6-thioguanine (6tg), an old drug still clinically used to treat leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis and bowel disease 14 , was identified as a potent usp2 inhibitor. further studies using enzyme kinetics and x-ray crystallography to delineate its direct binding to usp2 were performed. our findings support earlier results suggesting that 6tg has a broad spectrum of activity    , and have implications with respect to the need for direct clinical evaluation of its use against usp2-upregulated cancers.identification of inhibitors of human usp2. according to previous studies involving molecular docking experiments, the anti-leukemia and immunosuppressant drugs 6mp and 6tg, which act as inhibitors of sars and mers coronavirus papain-like proteases (plpros), may also be able to bind to the active site of human usp2 as both kinds of enzymes share the palm-thumb-fingers structural scaffold and conserved catalytic triad cys-his-asp/asn 17-20 . to validate the simulation results, the deubiquitination activity of the recombinant human usp2 catalytic domain (residues 258-605) was measured in the presence of various concentrations of 6mp or 6tg published: xx xx xxxx open  2 scientific reports | (2018) 8:3102 |","Shang-Ju Chuang, Shu-Chun Cheng, Hui-Chi Tang, Chiao-Yin Sun, Chi-Yuan Chou"
9909,Ebola virus disease and critical illness,"abstractas of 20 may 2016 there have been 28,646 cases and 11,323 deaths resulting from the west african ebola virus disease (evd) outbreak reported to the world health organization. there continue to be sporadic flare-ups of evd cases in west africa. evd presentation is nonspecific and characterized initially by onset of fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias, headache, and fever; this is followed several days later by anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. anorexia and gastrointestinal losses lead to dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and metabolic acidosis, and, in some patients, acute kidney injury. hypoxia and ventilation failure occurs most often with severe illness and may be exacerbated by substantial fluid requirements for intravascular volume repletion and some degree of systemic capillary leak. although minor bleeding manifestations are common, hypovolemic and septic shock complicated by multisystem organ dysfunction appear the most frequent causes of death. males and females have been equally affected, with children (0-14 years of age) accounting for 19 %, young adults (15-44 years) 58 %, and older adults (≥45 years) 23 % of reported cases. while the current case fatality proportion in west africa is approximately 40 %, it has varied substantially over time (highest near the outbreak onset) according to available resources (40-90 % mortality in west africa compared to under 20 % in western europe and the usa), by age (near universal among neonates and high among older adults), and by ebola viral load at admission. while there is no ebola virus-specific therapy proven to be effective in clinical trials, mortality has been dramatically lower among evd patients managed with supportive intensive care in highly resourced settings, allowing for the avoidance of hypovolemia, correction of electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities, and the provision of oxygen, ventilation, vasopressors, and dialysis when indicated. this experience emphasizes that, in addition to evaluating specific medical treatments, improving the global capacity to provide supportive critical care to patients with evd may be the greatest opportunity to improve patient outcomes.","Aleksandra Leligdowicz, William A Fischer Ii, Timothy M Uyeki, Thomas E Fletcher, Neill K J Adhikari, Gina Portella, Francois Lamontagne, Christophe Clement, Shevin T Jacob, Lewis Rubinson, Abel Vanderschuren, Jan Hajek, Srinivas Murthy, Mauricio Ferri, Ian Crozier, Marie-Claire Lamah, John S Schieffelin, David Brett-Major, Daniel G Bausch, Nikki Shindo, Adrienne K Chan, Tim O&apos;dempsey, Sharmistha Mishra, Michael Jacobs, Stuart Dickson, G Marshall, Lyon Iii, Robert A Fowler"
4343,"Identification of an infectious bronchitis coronavirus strain exhibiting a classical genotype but altered antigenicity, pathogenicity, and innate immunity profile OPEN","abstractworldwide. pathogenic ibv 3575/08 was isolated from broilers vaccinated with the attenuated viral vaccine derived from a taiwan strain 2575/98. in this study, extensive investigations were conducted on the genome sequences, antigenicity, pathogenicity, and host immune responses of several ibv strains in specific-pathogen-free chickens. sequence analyses revealed that 3575/08 and 2575/98 shared high homology in their structural genes, but not in non-structural accessory proteins such as 3a, 3b and 5b. despite a high degree of homology in their spike protein genes, cross neutralization test showed low cross protection between 3575/08 and 2575/98, suggesting distinct antigenicity for the two strains. animal challenge experiments exhibited strong respiratory and renal pathogenicity for 3575/08. in addition, early and prolonged viral shedding and rapid viral dissemination were observed. immune gene expression profiling by pcr array showed chickens infected with 3575/08 had delayed expression of a subset of early innate immune genes, whereas chickens infected with the wild-type or attenuatedtype 2575/08 revealed quick gene induction and efficient virus control. in summary, this study reveals a new ibv strain, which harbors a known local genotype but displays remarkably altered antigenicity, pathogenicity and host defenses.avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (ibv) is a member of coronaviridae family, and the virus is responsible for infectious bronchitis, an acute, highly contagious chicken viral disease. respiratory signs such as coughing, sneezing, and nasal discharge are the primary symptoms associated with ibv infections, and some of the strains also display kidney and oviduct tropisms, causing urogenital symptoms 1-3 . the disease poses economic threat to the poultry industry worldwide. more than 50 serotypes of ibv have been documented since the first isolation of virus in massachusetts (mass), us in the 1930 s 2 . the most commonly detected genotype of ibv in the us is ark-dpi, accounting for 23% to 65% of total isolation per year 4 . while most strains circulating in the us cause respiratory symptoms, nephropathogenic qx-like strains are dominant in europe 2 . in the far east, nephropathogenic lx4, ldl as well as proventricular-type qx-like strains have been reported frequently 2 . presently, vaccination is adopted to manage the disease, and mass type vaccine h120 is the most widely used vaccine formulation 2,5 . due to frequent strain variations, however, traditional mass type vaccines can be ineffective against infections by different ibv variants 2,5,6 . effective disease management thus demands better elucidation of strain variations.in taiwan, viral surveillance from 2005 to 2006 in poultry slaughterhouses showed the ibv flock prevalence was 17% and the chicken prevalence ranged from 1.8 to 3.7% 7 . most of the ibv isolates in taiwan are nephropathogenic strains 8, 9 . also, ibvs in taiwan are distinct from other genotypes in the world and can be divided into two subgroups, taiwan group i (tw-i) and taiwan group ii (tw-ii) 10,11 . as tw-i strains begin to emerge in neighboring areas in recent years 12-14 , there is a rising urgency to thoroughly investigate the tw ibv strains.ibv virion has a linear, positive sense and single-stranded genomic rna. its 27.6 kb genome contains at least ten open reading frames (orfs), 5′ -1a-1ab-s-3a-3b-e-m-5a-5b-n-3′ , encoding four structural proteins and several non-structural proteins (nsp) 3 . the four structural proteins include spike glycoprotein (s), envelope protein (e), membrane glycoprotein (m), and nucleocapsid protein (n). of the different structural proteins, the s protein, which comprises of s1 and s2 subunits, is responsible for host cell attachment and virus-cell membrane fusion and is the primary antigen target for virus neutralization. currently, genetic grouping for ibv is based primarily on the s1 gene 1-3 . among the genes that encode for non-structural proteins, the orf 1a and 1ab encode two polyproteins, which are further cleaved into 15 nsps. these and other non-structural accessory proteins 3a, 3b, 5a and 5b are associated with rna replication, virulence, and host-pathogen interactions of ibv 3 . however, the functions of these nsps remain largely unknown and warrant further studies.host innate antiviral immunity plays a critical role in viral clearance. in general, toll like receptor (tlr) families, retinoic acid-inducible gene i (rig-i) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (mda5, encoded by ifih1 gene) are intracellular pattern-recognition receptors (prrs) that function as viral infection detectors and all contribute to type i interferon (ifn) production 15 . as rig-i is absent in chickens, ifih1 is a functional compensate 16 . avian tlrs are different from their mammalian counterparts, lacking tlr9 but possessing tlr1la, poultry-specific tlr15, and a tlr9 homologue tlr21 17 . tlr3 and tlr7 are known to be involved in rna virus recognition, and its stimulation leads to activation of irf3 and irf7 (ifn-regulatory factor 3 and 7) . these factors then signal ifn transcription to trigger ifn-stimulated genes (isgs) through jak-stat pathway to express various antiviral proteins 15, 17, 18 . a global gene expression profiling of chicken kidney has revealed that 103 immune and inflammatory-related genes are involved in the host defense response during the first week of ibv infection 19 . the tlr3/7 and mda5 signaling pathways and innate immune cytokine were induced after ibv infection in chicken tracheas at 3-8 days post ibv m41 infection 20 . in addition, stat1 expression has also been found to be significantly elevated in response to ibv infection in ovo 21 . however, there is a lack of understanding of early antiviral immune responses induced by various ibv strains, particularly responses triggered by strains with close genetic relationship but distinct pathogenicity.to control ibv in taiwan, an embryo-attenuated strain (2575 at) derived from ibv tw-i strain 2575/98 wild type (2575 wt) has been developed as a vaccine 8 . these two strains were previously investigated to have close antigenicity 8 and limited sequence changes 22 . however, a novel tw-i strain 3575/08 emerged from a broiler chicken farm where the 2575 at vaccine was applied. ibv 3575/08 has been observed to cause high morbidity and mortality in affected broilers. in the present study, we compared the viral genome sequences of ibv 3575/08 and 2575/98 and investigated the infectivity and host immunity induced by 3575/08, 2575 wt, and 2575 at infections. to this end, sequence analysis, neutralization test, experimental infection, and immune-related gene profiling were performed. the results show that ibv 3575/08, which possesses heterologous orf 3a, 3b, and 5b sequences to 2575/98, caused a more deadly infection with early and prolonged viral shedding, stronger clinical and pathological manifestation, and delayed innate immune responses as compared to 2575 wt and 2575 at.","Shu-Yi Lin, Yao-Tsun Li, You-Ting Chen, Ting-Chih Chen, Che-Ming J Hu, Hui-Wen Chen"

and prolonged treatment with these therapeutic agents can result in adverse effects, such as pneumonia, cataracts, and osteoporosis  . therefore, non-pharmacological interventions are required to reduce the burden of asthma in both adults and children. understanding the roles of dietary nutrients in asthma and asthma-related complications may help in the management of this chronic inflammatory disease. hence, a systematic review of the intake of fruits and vegetables and their effects on immune responses and asthma risk is of interest. this paper aimed to describe studies investigating the effects of fruit and vegetable consumption on risk of asthma and wheezing and immune responses (including immune responses to virus infection and inflammation) in asthma and wheezing.methodspubmed, cochrane, cinahl and embase databases were included in the literature search, which was conducted in june 2016, including all previously published articles. studies were limited to humans with no language restrictions. additional studies were identified by hand searching references from the identified studies. see figure 1 for an example of the search strategy.only original studies with the following designs were included: randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, cohort studies, case-control studies, before and after studies, and cross sectional studies. case studies, case reports, animal studies, opinion papers, in vitro studies and conference abstracts were excluded. review articles were collected for the purposes of reviewing the reference list and did not contribute to the final number of included studies. the target study population was human of all age, gender or ethnicity, with asthma, wheeze, airway inflammation or other related respiratory symptoms. the exposure of interest was intake of whole or extracted fruit and vegetables. the study outcome measures were respiratory virus infection including human rhinovirus, influenza virus, corona virus and adenovirus;

4111,The Long Noncoding RNA NEAT1 Exerts Antihantaviral Effects by Acting as Positive Feedback for RIG-I Signaling,"abstracthantavirus infection, which causes zoonotic diseases with a high mortality rate in humans, has long been a global public health concern. over the past decades, accumulating evidence suggests that long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) play key regulatory roles in innate immunity. however, the involvement of host lncrnas in hantaviral control remains uncharacterized. in this study, we identified the lncrna neat1 as a vital antiviral modulator. neat1 was dramatically upregulated after hantaan virus (htnv) infection, whereas its downregulation in vitro or in vivo delayed host innate immune responses and aggravated htnv replication. ectopic expression of neat1 enhanced beta interferon (ifn-␤) production and suppressed htnv infection. further investigation suggested that neat1 served as positive feedback for rig-i signaling. htnv infection activated neat1 transcription through the rig-i-irf7 pathway, whereas neat1 removed the transcriptional inhibitory effects of the splicing factor proline-and glutamine-rich protein (sfpq) by relocating sfpq to paraspeckles, thus promoting the expression of rig-i and ddx60. rig-i and ddx60 had synergic effects on ifn production. taken together, our findings demonstrate that neat1 modulates the innate immune response against htnv infection, providing another layer of information about the role of lncrnas in controlling viral infections. importance hantaviruses have attracted worldwide attention as archetypal emerging pathogens. recently, increasing evidence has highlighted long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) as key regulators of innate immunity; however, their roles in hantavirus infection remain unknown. in the present work, a new unexplored function of lncrna neat1 in controlling htnv replication was found. neat1 promoted interferon (ifn) responses by acting as positive feedback for rig-i signaling. this lncrna was induced by htnv through the rig-i-irf7 pathway in a time-and dose-dependent manner and promoted htnv-induced ifn production by facilitating rig-i and ddx60 expression. intriguingly, neat1 relocated sfpq and formed paraspeckles after htnv infection, which might reverse inhibitive effects of sfpq on the transcription of rig-i and ddx60. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address the regulatory role of the lncrna neat1 in host innate immunity after htnv infection. in summary, our findings provide additional insights regarding the role of lncrnas in controlling viral infections. keywords long noncoding rna, neat1, hantaan virus, rig-i, ddx60, beta interferon, sfpq, interferons, innate immunity h antaviruses belong to the family bunyaviridae and genus hantavirus, and they have attracted worldwide attention as archetypal emerging pathogens (1). hantaviruses contain a tripartite negative-sense single-stranded rna (ssrna) genome, including small (s), medium (m), and large (l) genes, which encode nucleocapsid protein (np), f. 2017. the long noncoding rna neat1 exerts antihantaviral effects by acting as positive feedback for rig-i signaling. j virol 91:e02250-16. volume 91 issue 9 e02250-16 jvi.asm.org 1 journal of virologyfig 1 neat1 expression is induced by htnv in a time-and dose-dependent manner.

301,Viral fitness predicts the magnitude and direction of perturbations in the infected host transcriptome,"abstractis essential to evaluate their evolutionary potential. darwinian fitness, defined as the advantage of a given genotype with respect to a reference one, is a mesoscopic property that captures into a single figure differences in performance at every stage of viral infection. but to which extent viral fitness results from particular molecular interactions with host factors and regulatory networks during infection? can we identify host genes, and then functional classes, whose expression depends on viral fitness? here, we compared the transcriptomes of tobacco plants infected with seven genotypes of tobacco etch potyvirus (tev) that differ in fitness. we found that the larger the fitness differences among genotypes, the more dissimilar the transcriptomic profiles are. consistently, two different mutations, one in the viral rna polymerase and another in the viral suppressor of rna silencing, that led to close fitness values, also resulted in significantly similar gene expression profiles. moreover, we identified host genes whose expression showed a significant correlation, positive or negative, with tev fitness. over-expression of genes with positive correlation activates hormone-and rna silencing-mediated pathways of plant defense. by contrast, underexpression of genes negatively correlated reduces metabolism, growth, and development.fitness is a complex parameter often used by evolutionary biologists and ecologists to quantitatively describe the reproductive ability and evolutionary potential of an organism into a particular environment 1,2 . despite this apparently simple definition, measuring fitness is difficult and most studies only measure one or more fitness components (e.g., survival to maturity, fecundity, number of mates, or number of offspring produced) as proxies to total fitness 1,2 . in the field of virology, it has become standard to measure fitness by growth-competition experiments in mixed infections with a reference strain 3,4 . with this experimental set up, fitness is just the relative ability of a viral strain to produce stable infectious progeny in a given host (cell type, organ, individual, or species) when the available resources have to be shared with a competitor 5 .regardless its limitations, at least, this approach provides a metric for ranking viral strains according to their performance in a particular environment/host. such a fitness measure has been pivotal for quantitatively understanding many virus evolution processes: the effect of genetic bottlenecks and accumulation of deleterious mutations in rna virus populations 6-8 , the rates and dynamics of adaptive evolution into novel hosts 9, , the pleiotropic cost of host range expansion 10-12 , the cost of genome complexity 13,14 , the cost of antiviral escape mutations 15-17 , the topography of adaptive fitness landscapes 18-20 , and the role of robustness in virus evolution 21-23 .but differences in viral fitness should also matter in genome wide studies seeking to understand the mode of action of the viruses (i.e., the precise way they interact with their hosts).even though it has been argued that an integrative systems biology approach to viral pathogenesis would result in a better understanding of pathogenesis and in the identification of common targets for different viruses, therefore serving as a guide to a more rational design of therapeutic drugs 24-30 , pioneering studies have ignored the high genetic variability of viruses and subsequent differences in fitness and in mode of action. experimental evidences support that even single nucleotide substitutions have significant effects on viral fitness, regardless they are synonymous or nonsynonymous, or they affect coding or non-coding genomic regions 31-37 . a common trend among all these studies is that, whenever fitness is evaluated in the standard host, the distribution of mutational effects is highly skewed towards deleterious effects, with a large fraction of mutations being lethal. furthermore, increasing evidences suggest that the shape and location of the distribution of fitness effects depends on the host species, being the difference among two hosts (e.g., a tested host and the natural one) greater as their genetic divergence increases 12, 20, 38, 39 .together, all these observations suggest that the fitness of a given viral genotype depends not only on its own genetic background, but also on the host where fitness is evaluated. arguably, differences in viral fitness reflect differences in the virus-host interaction, with respect to a reference strain. as the cellular parasites they are, viruses need to kidnap all sort of cellular factors and resources, reprogram gene expression patterns into their own benefit, and block and interfere with cellular defenses. and all these processes take place embedded into the host complex network of intertwined interactions and regulations. interacting in suboptimal ways with .","Héctor Cervera, Silvia Ambrós, Guillermo P Bernet, Guillermo Rodrigo, Santiago F Elena"

were effectively inhibited. furthermore, ursolic acid effectively increased the production of no, ros, interleukin (il)-10, il-12, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm-csf), and interferon-β, while reducing the expression of il-1β, il-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (tgf-β1) in t. gondii-infected immune cells. these results demonstrate that ursolic acid not only causes anti-t. gondii activity/action by effectively inhibiting the survival of t. gondii and the subcellular organelles of t. gondii, but also induces specific immunomodulatory effects in t. gondii-infected immune cells. therefore, this study indicates that ursolic acid can be effectively utilized as a potential candidate agent for developing novel anti-toxoplasmosis drugs, and has immunomodulatory activity. different sub-proteins such as imc sub-compartment proteins 1, 2, and 3    . the protein kinases of t. gondii have been known to play key roles for modulating the motility, invasion, replication, egress, and survival within the host  . it was reported that t. gondii is divided through a unique form of cell division such as endodyogeny, and its chromosomal passenger complex is essential for the organization of a functional mitotic spindle  . furthermore, t. gondii not only forms a parasitophorous vacuole membrane (pvm) after invasion into host cells, but also proliferates and grows into a pvm -9]. for decades, several compounds through many researchers and groups were developed as drugs for treating toxoplasmosis, and are usefully used in clinics. however, existing drugs are widely vulnerable to drug-resistance in clinics globally. to overcome pharmacological barriers to these challenges, the efforts for treating infectious diseases have been attempted in various fields, and it has been reported that various extracts/compounds derived from medicinal plants and new synthetic compounds have anti-t. gondii effects in the in vitro and pre-clinic stages       . until recently, various compounds derived from plants have showed a leading role and ability as a source of specialized metabolites with medical effects as well as pharmacological activities. in addition, it was reported that various extracts/compounds derived from plants and synthetic compounds could be used in the medical field as useful resources for treating acute or chronic infectious diseases caused by schistosomiasis, leishmania, malaria, or tuberculosis, as well as viral diseases including middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) or zika fever and avian influenza         .however, effective next-generation drugs for treating toxoplasmosis have not yet been developed, and the difficulty of drug development against zoonosis is still causing a public health crisis globally. in this context, various studies on the development or discovery of effective drugs and novel candidates against parasitic zoonosis are urgently required. in this regard, ursolic acid is a bioactive compound derived from medicinal plants, and is also known to have selective bioactive properties such as anti-inflammatory -27] and anticancer effects     . it also effectively induces various activities, including antimicrobial -34] and anti-parasitic effects  36] . until recently, although studies and compounds regarding anti-t. gondii activity have been reported globally        , the mechanism of action of ursolic acid on the inhibitory effect of t. gondii and the immunomodulatory activity was not reported yet. from this perspective, this study was performed to evaluate the mechanism of action and the immunomodulatory activity of ursolic acid in terms of anti-t. gondii effects and activity, and to confirm the potential as a potent candidate drug for developing novel anti-toxoplasmosis agents.resultst. gondii has a specific network structure and systems, including various intracellular organelles such as the mitochondrion, apicoplast, dense granule, and rhoptry (figure 1) , which induces serious zoonotic diseases such as toxoplasmosis, particularly in humans, while causing infection in various vertebrates. before evaluating the mechanism of action of ursolic acid against t. gondii, we measured the inhibitory effect of ursolic acid (ua) against the survival of t. gondii and normal lung cells infected with t. gondii through an mtt assay as described previously  , which showed significant results and reproducibility. when t. gondii was treated with ua (12.5-400 µg/ml) for 24 h, the viability was effectively inhibited, and the parasitic survival rate was measured as less than 30% at 200 µg/ml. ua strongly decreased the viability of t. gondii compared with sulfadiazine (sf), which demonstrates that ua caused anti-t. gondii effect or activity against t. gondi (data not shown). in particular, the lung cells infected with t. gondii were markedly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with ursolic acid (12.5-200 µg/ml) when compared with the untreated infection cells and the t. gondii-infected cells treated with sf ( figure 2) . furthermore, it was clearly shown that there were significant differences between the untreated t. gondii-group and the experimental groups. in these aspects, it was demonstrated that ua effectively induced the selective anti-parasitic effect/action compared to the sf-treated group and the untreated group through a direct inhibitory effect on the pathogens 2019, 8, 61 3 of 18viability of t. gondii. this shows that ua has the potential to be utilized as an anti-t. gondii candidate agent and/or a synergic compound with the existing drugs for developing novel anti-toxoplasmosis agents. therefore, these results indicate that ua strongly inhibits or blocks the survival of t. gondii by effectively inducing anti-t. gondii activity through the selective inhibitory activity and/or action against the viability of t. gondii.","Won Hyung Choi, In Ah Lee"

3838,African Swine Fever Virus Armenia/07 Virulent Strain Controls Interferon Beta Production through the cGAS-STING Pathway VIRUS-CELL INTERACTIONS crossm,"abstractafrican swine fever virus (asfv) is a complex, cytoplasmic doublestranded dna (dsdna) virus that is currently expanding throughout the world. currently, circulating virulent genotype ii armenia/07-like viruses cause fatal disease in pigs and wild boar, whereas attenuated strains induce infections with various levels of chronic illness. sensing cytosolic dsdna, mainly by the key dna sensor cyclic gmp-amp synthase (cgas), leads to the synthesis of type i interferon and involves signaling through sting, tbk1, and irf3. after phosphorylation, sting translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi compartment and to the perinuclear region, acting as an indispensable adaptor connecting the cytosolic detection of dna to the tbk1-irf3 signaling pathway. we demonstrate here that attenuated nh/p68, but not virulent armenia/07, activates the cgas-sting-irf3 cascade very early during infection, inducing sting phosphorylation and trafficking through a mechanism involving cgamp. both tbk1 and irf3 are subsequently activated and, in response to this, a high level of beta interferon (ifn-␤) was produced during nh/p68 infection; in contrast, armenia/07 infection generated ifn-␤ levels below those of uninfected cells. our results show that virulent armenia/07 asfv controls the cgas-sting pathway, but these mechanisms are not at play when porcine macrophages are infected with attenuated nh/p68 asfv. these findings show for the first time the involvement of the cgas-sting-irf3 route in asfv infection, where ifn-␤ production or inhibition was found after infection by attenuated or virulent asfv strains, respectively, thus reinforcing the idea that asfv virulence versus attenuation may be a phenomenon grounded in asfv-mediated innate immune modulation where the cgas-sting pathway might play an important role. importance african swine fever, a devastating disease for domestic pigs and wild boar, is currently spreading in europe, russia, and china, becoming a global threat with huge economic and ecological consequences. one interesting aspect of asfv biology is the molecular mechanism leading to high virulence of some strains compared to more attenuated strains, which produce subclinical infections. in this work, we show that the presently circulating virulent armenia/07 virus blocks the synthesis of ifn-␤, a key mediator between the innate and adaptive immune response. armenia/07 inhibits the cgas-sting pathway by impairing sting activation during infection. in contrast, the cgas-sting pathway is efficiently activated during nh/p68 attenuated strain infection, leading to the production of large amounts of ifn-␤. our results show for the first time the relationship between the cgas-sting pathway and asfv virulence, contributing to uncover the molecular mechanisms of asfv virulence and to the rational development of asfv vaccines. 2 asfv virulent strain controls cgas-sting pathway journal of virology fig 2 effect of nh/p68 and armenia/07 infection on sting and irf3 phosphorylation. porcine alveolar macrophages were mock infected or infected with nh/p68 or armenia/07 strains (2 pfu/cell). cells were lysed in ripa buffer at 16 hpi (a) or at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 16 hpi with nh/p68 (b) or armenia/07 (c), and lysates were separated by 7 to 20% sds-page, followed by immunoblotting with anti-p-sting, anti-sting, anti-p-irf3, anti-irf3, anti-asfv p32 (viral early p32), and anti-actin antibodies. graphs below the panels b and c indicate the relative phosphorylated-sting versus total sting protein. densitometry was performed using imagej.","Raquel García-Belmonte, Daniel Pérez-Núñez, Marco Pittau, Juergen A Richt, Yolanda Revilla"

3182,FULL PAPER Virology p53-and ROS-mediated AIF pathway involved in TGEV-induced apoptosis,"abstractwe previously demonstrated that transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev) could induce apoptosis through caspase signaling. however, apoptosis was not completely prevented by caspases inhibitors, suggesting that there may be a caspase-independent pathway involved in tgev-induced cell apoptosis. in this study, we investigated the regulation of apoptosis-inducing factor (aif) on tgev-induced apoptotic pathway. results indicated that aif translocated from the mitochondria to nucleus during tgev infection, and the aif inhibitor, n-phenylmaleimide (np), significantly attenuated the apoptosis. in addition, the translocation of aif was inhibited by veliparib (abt-888), an inhibitor of poly (adp-ribose) polymerase (parp). and the reactive oxygen species (ros) scavenger, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamic (pdtc), redistributed aif in the mitochondria and nucleus in tgev-infected cells. moreover, the protein levels in nucleus and the mrna levels of aif were inhibited in the presence of the p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-α (pft-α) or in tgev-infected p53−/−cells. furthermore, tgev-induced apoptosis was blocked by combination of three or more inhibitors, such as pan caspase inhibitor z-vad-fmk, np, abt-888, pdtc, pft-α, to treat pk-15 cells. taken together, these results suggest that the p53-and ros-mediated aif pathway and caspasedependent pathway were involved in tgev-induced apoptosis.","Li Ding, ) # , Jiawei Li, Weihao Li, Zhenhua Fang, Na Li, Shannan Wu, Jiangyue Li, Meiling Hong"

10093,A Multi-Omics Study of Chicken Infected by Nephropathogenic Infectious Bronchitis Virus,"abstractchicken gout resulting from nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (nibv) has become a serious kidney disease problem in chicken worldwide with alterations of the metabolic phenotypes in multiple metabolic pathways. to investigate the mechanisms in chicken responding to nibv infection, we examined the global transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles of the chicken's kidney using rna-seq and gc-tof/ms, respectively. furthermore, we analyzed the alterations in cecal microorganism composition in chickens using 16s rrna-seq. integrated analysis of these three phenotypic datasets further managed to create correlations between the altered kidney transcriptomes and metabolome, and between kidney metabolome and gut microbiome. we found that 2868 genes and 160 metabolites were deferentially expressed or accumulated in the kidney during nibv infection processes. these genes and metabolites were linked to nibv-infection related processes, including immune response, signal transduction, peroxisome, purine, and amino acid metabolism. in addition, the comprehensive correlations between the kidney metabolome and cecal microbial community showed contributions of gut microbiota in the progression of nibv-infection. taken together, our research comprehensively describes the host responses during nibv infection and provides new clues for further dissection of specific gene functions, metabolite affections, and the role of gut microbiota during chicken gout. astrovirus (castv), and nibv  6, 7] . currently, nibv that causes visceral gout in chicken has become a research hotspot  8] .nibv has become the most common ibv strain in the commercial poultry industry. it is a gamma coronavirus in the coronavirus family that exhibit strong renal tropism and has become one of the most familiar pathogens that induce visceral gout outbreaks    . initially, some ibv strains have been called nephropathogenic ibv because the starting respiratory infection was followed by a heavy kidney infection. a large number of previous research findings indicate that clinical symptoms of nephropathogenic ibv strains infection include increased water consumption, depression, watery droppings, and significant mortality. notably, necropsy of chicks that died during nephropathogenic ibv infection showed enlarged and pale kidneys and monosodium urate crystal deposition in the renal tubules and ureters  . according to histopathology, nibv replicates on the epithelial surface of the kidney and causes particle degeneration, vacuolation, and desquamation of the tubular epithelium, as well as massive infiltration of heterophilic granulocytes in the stroma  . however, there is a substantial lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of nibv infection. in addition, it is well known that the gut microbial community is closely associated with the progression of diseases, and inoue et al. also confirmed that hepatitis c virus infection is associated with gut dysbiosis  . in our study, we focus on the cecum as organs of particular interest as they harbor the highest microbial cell densities (up to 10 11 cells g −1 ) and are significant sites for recycling of urea, water regulation, and carbohydrate fermentations  16] . therefore, we suspect that the gut microbiota may be associated with the progression of visceral gout induced by nibv infection.nowadays, omics technology is increasingly being used to understand intricate biological systems and reveal the molecular characteristics behind complex cellular phenotypes  18] . applications of omics platforms include the identification of genes (genomics), messenger rna (mrna, transcriptomics), proteins (proteomics), and metabolites (metabolomics). moreover, the research of the gut microbiota (microbiomics) has brought increasing concern due to its important affection for different diseases  . many scholars have used multi-omics analysis to make great progress in deciphering the pathogenesis of diseases, such as alzheimer's disease  , familial type 1 diabetes , autoimmune diseases  , and cardiovascular diseases  . however, to date, there has been very few omics analyses for the study of poultry diseases, and in particular, as far as we know, there is no omics analysis for the study of the pathogenesis of nibv infection.the antiviral and metabolic changes caused by viruses result in a highly complicated process that requires the coordination of diverse intertwined signalling and metabolic pathways. therefore, a large-scale and comprehensive analysis of viral target tissues is needed to better understand the pathogenesis of the nibv infection. we first replicated the visceral gout model by infecting chickens with nibv and conducted an integrated transcriptomic, metabolomics, and microbiomics analyses. the characterization of these identified genes, metabolites, and microbiota clearly reflected the dynamic changes in the biological processes in chickens with nibv infection. overall, our research comprehensively describes the host responses during nibv infection

however, the universal s1 pcr was created to work from cultured ibv and it is inefficient at detecting mixed isolates. this paper describes a minion-based ampseq method that genetically typed ibv from clinical samples, including samples with multiple isolates. total rna was extracted from fifteen tracheal scrapings and choanal cleft swab samples, randomly reverse transcribed, and pcr amplified using modified s1-targeted primers. amplicons were barcoded to allow for pooling of samples, processed per manufacturer's instructions into a 1d minion sequencing library, and sequenced on the minion. the ampseq method detected ibv in 13 of 14 ibv-positive samples.ampseq accurately detected and genotyped both ibv lineages in three of five samples containing two ibv lineages. additionally, one sample contained three ibv lineages, and ampseq accurately detected two of the three. strain identification, including detection of different strains from the same lineage, was also possible with this ampseq method. the results demonstrate the feasibility of using minion-based ampseq for rapid and accurate identification and lineage typing of ibv from oral swab samples.infectious bronchitis virus is an enveloped, pleomorphic gammacoronavirus with an unsegmented, single-stranded, positive-sense, 26-27.8 kb, rna genome that encodes the nonstructural polyprotein,1a and 1b, and several structural proteins: spike (s), envelop (e), membrane (m) and nucleocapsid (n). 38,41 in addition, two accessory genes, expressing 3a, 3b and 5a and 5b, respectively, have also been described. 6, 14, 38 the s protein is highly glycosylated and post-translational cleavage leads to two subunits: s1 and s2. 10,48 besides acting as the viral attachment protein, the s1 protein is a major target of neutralizing antibodies. 7 as with many attachment proteins that are targets of virus-neutralizing antibodies, the s1 subunit is highly diverse with almost 50% of the amino acids differing among ibv serotypes. 2,21,38 such variation leads to important biological differences between ibv serotypes and the emergence of novel variants. more than 60 serotypes of ibv have been reported, but the most common serotypes of all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.massachusetts. 16 this genetic diversity leads to emergence of new serotypes and a lack of complete cross-serotype protection by vaccines. 29 the correlation of ibv genotypes and serotypes of ibv has been reported 45 ; therefore, accurate genotypic identification of ibv is an important step to diagnose ibv in clinical respiratory cases, ensure selection of proper ibv vaccines for use in vaccination programs, and to better understand the epidemiology of this global virus.one of the recent comprehensive classification schemes for ibv uses s1 gene sequencebased phylogeny of ibv and identified six genotypes (i-vi), 32 sub-genotypic lineages, and a number of inter-lineage recombinants in global strains of ibv. 44 among the six genotypes, genotype i (g-i) is the most diverse group of viruses, with 27 unique lineages. 44 as such, sequencing of the s1 subunit provides important information regarding the classification of ibv within samples.the genetic classification of ibv has relied on genotype-specific rt-qpcr assays, serotype-specific s1 rt-qpcr 32,40 and/or pan-ibv s1 rt-pcr assays coupled with sanger sequencing. 8,31,49 genotype-specific rt-qpcrs are limited to short fragments, which may miss important changes in the s1 (~1.6 kb) 44 outside the short target. additionally, since the target is short, the primers lie within the variable regions of the s1 and may require a different assay for each genotype. lastly, the pan-ibv s1 primers 1, 17, 22, 23, 25, 33 , while only requiring one reaction, have relatively low sensitivity and are typically used only on egg-cultured virus, which adds an additional, time consuming step and many diagnostic labs do not have spf embryos readily available. lastly, cloning of pcr products has been used to detect multiple ibv sub-populations in the sample 30 ; however, this is inefficient when potentially dealing with multiple (three or four) all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.the copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. .  doi: biorxiv preprint ibv types. as such, the development of a pan-ibv sequencing method to rapidly determine the genotype(s) in samples would aid in lineage typing and tracking of ibv genotypes circulating in poultry flocks.recently, third generation sequencing technology has been used for detection of viral nucleotides and sequencing ultra-long dna molecules. 34 the minion nanopore sequencer, a new dna sequencing technology that allows for rapid, in-house, real-time technique detection and differentiation of ibv lineages, may be cost effective and useful in the field. 19 ampliconbased sequencing has also been used to amplify specific regions of newcastle disease 3,13 , infectious laryngotracheitis virus 39 zika 34 , ebola 35 and avian influenza viruses 46 , by simple rt-pcr and then sequencing on the minion device. real-time data analysis, the lack of significant start-up cost investment or maintenance expenses, simultaneous and sequential multiplexing unique to minion, and the ability to sequence long dna molecules so that primers are in conserved regions while the product contains the variable region are the features that make this technology highly feasible to be used for disease diagnostics.accurate identification of ibv genotypes from samples, including detection of multiple isolates from a single sample, is crucial to respiratory disease diagnosis, selection of appropriate ibv vaccines, and epidemiologic studies. therefore, the aim of the current study is to create a single, amplicon-based protocol to sequence ibv-s1 gene and develop a sequence analysis workflow to identify ibv isolates from clinical swab samples. this method provides a useful assay for ibv and a model for the development of future amplicon sequencing (ampseq) based assays.all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.a universal s1 primer set, 27 tailed with the minion universal adapter sequence of 22 nucleotides (underlined, table 2 ) to allow barcoding of amplicons, was used for targeted amplification of the ibv s1 gene for ibv. the pcr reaction mixture (expand high fidelity pcr system, roche diagnostics, mannheim, germany) was composed of 10 µl of cdna, 1 µl of 10 µm forward primer, 1 µl of 10 µm reverse primer, 2.5 µl of 10× expand high fidelity buffer, 1 µl of expand high fidelity enzyme mix, and 1 µl of 10mm dntps, to a final volume to 25 µl with 9 µl of nuclease-free water. the following thermocycling conditions were used for amplicon synthesis: denaturation at 95 °c for 2 min; 30 cycles of 94 °c for 1 min, 45 °c for 2 min, and 72 °c for 2 minutes, and final extension at 72 °c for 10 min. see table 2 for details about all three primer sets used in this study. pcr products were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose with sybr safe dna gel stain (invitrogen) for visual evaluation. amplified dna was purified by agencourt ampure xp beads (beckman coulter, usa) at 1.6:1 (volumetric bead:dna) and quantified using the dsdna high sensitivity assay kit on a qubit® fluorimeter 3.0.the amplicons obtained from the tailed s1 primer set were then used to prepare minioncompatible dna libraries. briefly, each of the amplicons were diluted to 0.5 nm and amplified using barcoding primers (1d pcr barcoding amplicon kit, oxford nanopore technologies, ont], uk) and longamp taq 2x master mix (new england biolabs, ma, usa) with the following conditions: 95 °c for 3 min; 15 cycles of 95 °c for 15 seconds, 62 °c for 15 seconds, 65 °c for 80 seconds; and 65 °c for 80 seconds. the barcoded amplicons were bead purified (1:1.4; bead:solution), pooled (run1; pool of 10 samples, run2;

however, future testing of this new technology will allow for creating standards for such confirmatory testing.taken together, these results suggest the application of minion-based ampseq, specifically for detecting ibv isolates from clinical samples within a few days, compared to several days to weeks and multiple diagnostic assays to culture and detect multiple ibv all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.","Salman L Butt, Eric C Erwood, Jian Zhang, Holly S Sellers, Kelsey Young, Kevin K Lahmers, James B Stanton"

8680,Transcriptional and Translational Landscape of Equine Torovirus GENOME REPLICATION AND REGULATION OF VIRAL GENE EXPRESSION crossm,"abstractthe genus torovirus (subfamily torovirinae, family coronaviridae, order nidovirales) encompasses a range of species that infect domestic ungulates, including cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and horses, causing an acute self-limiting gastroenteritis. using the prototype species equine torovirus (etov), we performed parallel rna sequencing (rna-seq) and ribosome profiling (ribo-seq) to analyze the relative expression levels of the known torovirus proteins and transcripts, chimeric sequences produced via discontinuous rna synthesis (a characteristic of the nidovirus replication cycle), and changes in host transcription and translation as a result of etov infection. rna sequencing confirmed that etov utilizes a unique combination of discontinuous and nondiscontinuous rna synthesis to produce its subgenomic rnas (sgrnas); indeed, we identified transcripts arising from both mechanisms that would result in sgrnas encoding the nucleocapsid. our ribosome profiling analysis revealed that ribosomes efficiently translate two novel cug-initiated open reading frames (orfs), located within the so-called 5= untranslated region. we have termed the resulting proteins u1 and u2. comparative genomic analysis confirmed that these orfs are conserved across all available torovirus sequences, and the inferred amino acid sequences are subject to purifying selection, indicating that u1 and u2 are functionally relevant. this study provides the first high-resolution analysis of transcription and translation in this neglected group of livestock pathogens. importance toroviruses infect cattle, goats, pigs, and horses worldwide and can cause gastrointestinal disease. there is no treatment or vaccine, and their ability to spill over into humans has not been assessed. these viruses are related to important human pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) coronavirus, and they share some common features; however, the mechanism that they use to produce sgrna molecules differs. here, we performed deep sequencing to determine how equine torovirus produces sgrnas. in doing so, we also identified two previously unknown open reading frames ""hidden"" within the genome. together these results highlight the similarities and differences between this domestic animal virus and related pathogens of humans and livestock.t he order nidovirales currently contains four families of positive-sense, singlestranded rna viruses: the coronaviridae, arteriviridae, roniviridae, and mesoniviridae (1). their grouping into the one taxonomic order is based upon replicase protein conservation, genome organization, and replication strategy. however, these viral families are nonetheless very diverse with respect to their virion structure, host range, pathogenic potential, and genome size.the genus torovirus (family coronaviridae, subfamily torovirinae) encompasses a range of species with worldwide distribution that infect domestic ungulates, including citation stewart h, brown k, dinan am, irigoyen n, snijder ej, firth ae. 2018. transcriptional and translational landscape of equine torovirus. j virol 92:e00589-18. https:// fig 1 schematic of the equine torovirus genome (etov). open reading frames (orfs) are colored according to their respective reading frames (pink, phase 0; yellow, phase ϫ1; blue, phase ϩ1). polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are translated from genomic rna, with pp1ab generated via ϫ1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting. structural proteins are translated from a series of sgrnas. untranslated regions of sgrnas are represented by black bars. the leader transcription regulatory sequence (trs) (green) and putative body trss (blue) are displayed below the viral genome. the frameshift site and a putative rna hairpin involved in s sgrna synthesis are indicated above the genome. stewart et al. journal of virology september 2018 volume 92 issue 17 e00589-18 jvi.asm.org 2tandem rna-seq and ribo-seq of etov-infected cells. we conducted tandem rna-seq and ribo-seq of etov-infected equine dermal (ed) cells. two biological replicates of virus-infected and mock-infected cells were analyzed, generating 25 to 53 million reads per sample. for rna-seq, 77 to 92% of reads mapped to the host genome, of which a mean of 1.5% mapped to rrna, 19% to mrna, 32% to noncoding rna (ncrna), and 47% elsewhere in the genome. for ribo-seq, 46 to 60% of reads mapped to the host genome, of which a mean of 56% mapped to rrna, 13% to mrna, 4.9% to ncrna, and 26% elsewhere in the genome (see table s1 in the supplemental material). totals of 1.3% and 2.3% of reads mapped to the virus genome in the two etov-infected rna-seq replicates and 0.41% and 0.21% in the two etov-infected ribo-seq replicates.","Hazel Stewart, Katherine Brown, Adam M Dinan, Nerea Irigoyen, Eric J Snijder, Andrew E Firth, Julie K Pfeiffer"

6835,Marked Variability in the Extent of Protein Disorder within and between Viral Families,"abstractintrinsically disordered regions in eukaryotic proteomes contain key signaling and regulatory modules and mediate interactions with many proteins. many viral proteomes encode disordered proteins and modulate host factors through the use of short linear motifs (slims) embedded within disordered regions. however, the degree of viral protein disorder across different viruses is not well understood, so we set out to establish the constraints acting on viruses, in terms of their use of disordered protein regions. we surveyed predicted disorder across 2,278 available viral genomes in 41 families, and correlated the extent of disorder with genome size and other factors. protein disorder varies strikingly between viral families (from 2.9% to 23.1% of residues), and also within families. however, this substantial variation did not follow the established trend among their hosts, with increasing disorder seen across eubacterial, archaebacterial, protists, and multicellular eukaryotes. for example, among large mammalian viruses, poxviruses and herpesviruses showed markedly differing disorder (5.6% and 17.9%, respectively). viral families with smaller genome sizes have more disorder within each of five main viral types (ssdna, dsdna, ssrna+, dsrna, retroviruses), except for negative single-stranded rna viruses, where disorder increased with genome size. however, surveying over all viruses, which compares tiny and enormous viruses over a much bigger range of genome sizes, there is no strong association of genome size with protein disorder. we conclude that there is extensive variation in the disorder content of viral proteomes. while a proportion of this may relate to base composition, to extent of gene overlap, and to genome size within viral types, there remain important additional family and virus-specific effects. differing disorder strategies are likely to impact on how different viruses modulate host factors, and on how rapidly viruses can evolve novel instances of slims subverting host functions, such as innate and acquired immunity.","Ravindra Pushker, Catherine Mooney, Norman E Davey, Jean-Marc Jacqué, Denis C Shields"

5661,Molecular Sciences Review Focus on Translation Initiation of the HIV-1 mRNAs,"abstractto replicate and disseminate, viruses need to manipulate and modify the cellular machinery for their own benefit. we are interested in translation, which is one of the key steps of gene expression and viruses that have developed several strategies to hijack the ribosomal complex. the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus is a good paradigm to understand the great diversity of translational control. indeed, scanning, leaky scanning, internal ribosome entry sites, and adenosine methylation are used by ribosomes to translate spliced and unspliced hiv-1 mrnas, and some require specific cellular factors, such as the ddx3 helicase, that mediate mrna export and translation. in addition, some viral and cellular proteins, including the hiv-1 tat protein, also regulate protein synthesis through targeting the protein kinase pkr, which once activated, is able to phosphorylate the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eif2α, which results in the inhibition of cellular mrnas translation. finally, the infection alters the integrity of several cellular proteins, including initiation factors, that directly or indirectly regulates translation events. in this review, we will provide a global overview of the current situation of how the hiv-1 mrnas interact with the host cellular environment to produce viral proteins.","Sylvain De Breyne, Théophile Ohlmann"
11440,Identification of Host-Immune Response Protein Candidates in the Sera of Human Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients,"abstractone of the most common cancers worldwide is oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc), which is associated with a significant death rate and has been linked to several risk factors. notably, failure to detect these neoplasms at an early stage represents a fundamental barrier to improving the survival and quality of life of oscc patients. in the present study, serum samples from oscc patients (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 25) were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-de) and silver staining in order to identify biomarkers that might allow early diagnosis. in this regard, 2-de spots corresponding to various up-and down-regulated proteins were sequenced via high-resolution maldi-tof mass spectrometry and analyzed using the mascot database. we identified the following differentially expressed host-specific proteins within sera from oscc patients: leucine-rich a2-glycoprotein (lrg), alpha-1-b-glycoprotein (abg), clusterin (clu), pro2044, haptoglobin (hap), complement c3c (c3), proapolipoprotein a1 (proapo-a1), and retinol-binding protein 4 precursor (rbp4). moreover, five non-host factors were detected, including bacterial antigens from acinetobacter lwoffii, burkholderia multivorans, myxococcus xanthus, laribacter hongkongensis, and streptococcus salivarius. subsequently, we analyzed the immunogenicity of these proteins using pooled sera from oscc patients. in this regard, five of these candidate biomarkers were found to be immunoreactive: clu, hap, c3, proapo-a1 and rbp4. taken together, our immunoproteomics approach has identified various serum biomarkers that could facilitate the development of early diagnostic tools for oscc.","Y Chen, S N Azman, J P Kerishnan, R B Zain, Y N Chen"
13565,Infection and Drug Resistance Management strategies in the treatment of neonatal and pediatric gastroenteritis,"abstractacute gastroenteritis, characterized by the onset of diarrhea with or without vomiting, continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children in mostly resourceconstrained nations. although generally a mild and self-limiting disease, gastroenteritis is one of the most common causes of hospitalization and is associated with a substantial disease burden. worldwide, up to 40% of children aged less than 5 years with diarrhea are hospitalized with rotavirus. also, some microorganisms have been found predominantly in resource-constrained nations, including shigella spp, vibrio cholerae, and the protozoan infections. prevention remains essential, and the rotavirus vaccines have demonstrated good safety and efficacy profiles in large clinical trials. because dehydration is the major complication associated with gastroenteritis, appropriate fluid management (oral or intravenous) is an effective and safe strategy for rehydration. continuation of breastfeeding is strongly recommended. new treatments such as antiemetics (ondansetron), some antidiarrheal agents (racecadotril), and chemotherapeutic agents are often proposed, but not yet universally recommended. probiotics, also known as ""food supplement,"" seem to improve intestinal microbial balance, reducing the duration and the severity of acute infectious diarrhea. the european society for paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition and the european society of paediatric infectious diseases guidelines make a stronger recommendation for the use of probiotics for the management of acute gastroenteritis, particularly those with documented efficacy such as lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus reuteri, and saccharomyces boulardii. to date, the management of acute gastroenteritis has been based on the option of ""doing the least"": oral rehydration-solution administration, early refeeding, no testing, no unnecessary drugs.","Simona Ciccarelli, Ilaria Stolfi, Giuseppe Caramia"
8778,BMC Molecular Biology Appropriate 'housekeeping' genes for use in expression profiling the effects of environmental estrogens in fish,"abstractbackground: attempts to develop a mechanistic understanding of the effects of environmental estrogens on fish are increasingly conducted at the level of gene expression. appropriate application of real-time pcr in such studies requires the use of a stably expressed 'housekeeping' gene as an internal control to normalize for differences in the amount of starting template between samples.: we sought to identify appropriate genes for use as internal controls in experimental treatments with estrogen by analyzing the expression of eight functionally distinct 'housekeeping' genes (18s ribosomal rna s rrna], ribosomal protein l8 rpl8], elongation factor 1 alpha ef1a], glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase g6pd], beta actin bactin], glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh], hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 hprt1], and tata box binding protein tbp]) following exposure to the environmental estrogen, 17α-ethinylestradiol (ee 2 ), in the fathead minnow (pimephales promelas). exposure to 10 ng/l ee 2 for 21 days down-regulated the expression of ef1a, g6pd, bactin and gapdh in the liver, and bactin and gapdh in the gonad. some of these effects were gender-specific, with bactin in the liver and gapdh in the gonad down-regulated by ee 2 in males only. furthermore, when ef1a, g6pd, bactin or gapdh were used for normalization, the hepatic expression of two genes of interest, vitellogenin (vtg) and cytochrome p450 1a (cyp1a) following exposure to ee 2 was overestimated.conclusion: based on the data presented, we recommend 18s rrna, rpl8, hprt1 and/or tbp, but not ef1a, g6pd, bactin and/or gapdh, as likely appropriate internal controls in real-time pcr studies of estrogens effects in fish. our studies show that pre-validation of control genes considering the scope and nature of the experiments to be performed, including both gender and tissue type, is critical for accurate assessments of the effects of environmental estrogens on gene expression in fish.","Amy L Filby, Charles R Tyler"
11367,"Pathogenicity of Genetically Similar, H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus Strains in Chicken and the Differences in Sensitivity among Different Chicken Breeds","abstractdifferences in the pathogenicity of genetically closely related h5n1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (hpaivs) were evaluated in white leghorn chickens. these viruses varied in the clinical symptoms they induced, including lethality, virus shedding, and replication in host tissues. a comparison of the host responses in the lung, brain, and spleen suggested that the differences in viral replication efficiency were related to the host cytokine response at the early phase of infection, especially variations in the proinflammatory cytokine il-6. based on these findings, we inoculated the virus that showed the mildest pathogenicity among the five tested, a/pigeon/thailand/vsmu-7-npt/2004, into four breeds of thai indigenous chicken, phadu-hung-dang (phd), chee, dang, and luang-hung-khao (lhk), to explore effects of genetic background on host response. among these breeds, chee, dang, and lhk showed significantly longer survival times than white leghorns. virus shedding from dead thai indigenous chickens was significantly lower than that from white leghorns. although polymorphisms were observed in the mx and mhc class i genes, there was no significant association between the polymorphisms in these loci and resistance to hpaiv.","Aya Matsuu, Tomoko Kobayashi, Tuangthong Patchimasiri, Takashi Shiina, Shingo Suzuki, Kridsada Chaichoune, Parntep Ratanakorn, Yasuaki Hiromoto, Haruka Abe, Sujira Parchariyanon, Takehiko Saito"
10453,viruses Exploiting the Legacy of the Arbovirus Hunters,"abstractin recent years, it has become evident that a generational gap has developed in the community of arbovirus research. this apparent gap is due to the dis-investment of training for the next generation of arbovirologists, which threatens to derail the rich history of virus discovery, field epidemiology, and understanding of the richness of diversity that surrounds us. on the other hand, new technologies have resulted in an explosion of virus discovery that is constantly redefining the virosphere and the evolutionary relationships between viruses. this paradox presents new challenges that may have immediate and disastrous consequences for public health when yet to be discovered arboviruses emerge. in this review we endeavor to bridge this gap by providing a historical context for the work being conducted today and provide continuity between the generations. to this end, we will provide a narrative of the thrill of scientific discovery and excitement and the challenges lying ahead. original viruses (known and unknown) that came along with the staff from the former rf virus laboratory in new york, but over the years, as new viruses were submitted for study or were isolated by yaru investigators, they were also added to the wrca collection  . as the former rf personnel retired, new researchers were recruited to yaru as full yale university faculty . because of its prestige and university affiliation, many visiting scientists, graduate students, and other trainees from the u.s. and a variety of other countries came to yaru during this period to learn arboviral techniques, to do original research, and to identify samples collected by them during outbreaks or field studies. these samples were also added to the wrca collection. many of these visitors, as well as some of the younger yaru faculty, eventually moved on to assume prominent positions in academia, government service, or the corporate world. shope  and downs  have described some of the significant activities, accomplishments, and international collaborations during the early years of yaru.without continued support from the rf or from yale university, the yaru staff, like other university scientists in the u.s., had to compete for grants and contracts to support their research. health  . shope was also an early proponent of the effect of ecological and global climate changes on arboviral and other vector-borne diseases  16] , and he often served on national and international committees addressing this problem.consultancies, service on government committees and free diagnostic laboratory support (the old rf model) could not provide sufficient funds to maintain and recruit new personnel, upgrade equipment, or support a major research program at a university in the u.s. in turn, leaders at yale medical school decided that arbovirology was passé and that other areas, such as hiv/aids, environmental health, and molecular biology, offered better funding and research opportunities for the 1980s. thus, yaru gradually lost university support, faculty positions, and space. in 1995, after 30 years at yale, shope retired. along with his colleague robert tesh, he moved to the newly established center for tropical diseases at the university of texas medical branch in galveston  . the extensive wrca virus and reagent collections went with them. their departure and the loss of the wrca collections was soon followed by the departure of other, younger, faculty associates, resulting in the eventual demise of yaru as a center for arbovirus research and discovery.","Nikos Vasilakis, Robert B Tesh, Vsevolod L Popov, Steve G Widen, Thomas G Wood, Naomi L Forrester, Jean Paul Gonzalez, Jean Francois Saluzzo, Sergey Alkhovsky, Sai Kit Lam, John S Mackenzie, Peter J Walker"

6428,"Beyond phage display: non-traditional applications of the filamentous bacteriophage as a vaccine carrier, therapeutic biologic, and bioconjugation scaffold","abstractfor the past 25 years, phage display technology has been an invaluable tool for studies of protein-protein interactions. however, the inherent biological, biochemical, and biophysical properties of filamentous bacteriophage, as well as the ease of its genetic manipulation, also make it an attractive platform outside the traditional phage display canon. this review will focus on the unique properties of the filamentous bacteriophage and highlight its diverse applications in current research. particular emphases are placed on: (i) the advantages of the phage as a vaccine carrier, including its high immunogenicity, relative antigenic simplicity and ability to activate a range of immune responses, (ii) the phage's potential as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent for infectious and chronic diseases, (iii) the regularity of the virion major coat protein lattice, which enables a variety of bioconjugation and surface chemistry applications, particularly in nanomaterials, and (iv) the phage's large population sizes and fast generation times, which make it an excellent model system for directed protein evolution. despite their ubiquity in the biosphere, metagenomics work is just beginning to explore the ecology of filamentous and non-filamentous phage, and their role in the evolution of bacterial populations. thus, the filamentous phage represents a robust, inexpensive, and versatile microorganism whose bioengineering applications continue to expand in new directions, although its limitations in some spheres impose obstacles to its widespread adoption and use.","Piergiuseppe De Berardinis, Kevin A Henry, Mehdi Arbabi-Ghahroudi, Jamie K Scott"

1809,Simultaneous detection of eleven sexually transmitted agents using multiplexed PCR coupled with MALDI-TOF analysis,"abstractpurpose: sexually transmitted infections (stis), representing a major global health problem, are caused by different microbes, including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. unfortunately, infections of different sexually transmitted pathogens often present similar clinical symptoms, so it is almost impossible to distinguish them clinically. therefore, the aim of the current study was to develop a sensitive, multitarget, and high-throughput method that can detect various agents responsible for stis.methods: we developed and tested a 23-plex pcr coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry (ms) assay (sexually transmitted infection-mass spectrometry, sti-ms) that simultaneously targets 11 different agents, including 8 most common clinical pathogens related to stis (hsv-1, hsv-2, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, treponema pallidum, trichomonas vaginalis, mycoplasma genitalium, and haemophilus ducreyi) and 3 controversial microorganisms as pathogens (mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and ureaplasma parvum).the results showed that the sti-ms approach can accurately detect the expected agents, without cross-reaction with other organisms. the limit of detection of each sti-ms assay was ranged from 1.739 to 10.009 copies/reaction, using probit analyses. the verification rate for each target organism of the sti-ms ranged from a minimum of 89.3% to a maximum of 100%, using conventional assays and ultrasensitive digital pcr to confirm the sti-ms-positive results. to further evaluate the clinical performance of this assay, 241 clinical specimens (124 urethral/cervical swabs and 117 urine) were tested in parallel using the sti-ms assay and monoplex real-time pcr for each agent. the overall validation parameters of sti-ms were extremely high including sensitivity (from 85.7% to 100%), specificity (from 92.3% to 100%), ppv (from 50% to 100%), and npv (from 99.1% to 100%) for each target. conclusion: sti-ms is a useful high-throughput screening tool for detecting mixed infections of stis and has great potential for application in large-scale epidemiological programs for specific microorganisms of sti.","Leshan Xiu, Chi Zhang, Yamei Li, Feng Wang, Junping Peng"

11423,Parasites & Vectors Wild canids as sentinels of ecological health: a conservation medicine perspective Open Access Background,"abstractthe extinction of species across the globe is accelerating, directly or indirectly due to human activities. biological impoverishment, habitat fragmentation, climate change, increasing toxification, and the rapid global movement of people and other living organisms have worked synergistically to diminish ecosystem function. this has resulted in unprecedented levels of disease emergence, driven by human-induced environmental degradation, which poses a threat to the survival and health of biodiversity.the emerging discipline of conservation medicine addresses these concerns through the following entities: humans; global climate; habitat destruction and alteration; biodiversity, including wildlife populations; domestic animals; and pathogens, parasites and pollutants. furthermore, conservation medicine focuses on explicit linkages between these entities. as a crisis discipline, the usefulness of conservation medicine ultimately will depend on its applicability to solving problems.the perspectives and scientific findings of conservation medicine provide input into biomedical education; and policy and management of ecosystems, habitats and imperiled species. a sentinel species is one that has presented itself, or has been selected, to provide insight into the state (health) of an ecosystem, based on user-defined (e.g., researchers, conservationists or policymakers) objectives (e.g., disease, parasites, toxics, climate change, habitat destruction), coupled with the utility and vulnerability of this species to the perceived stress. the scientific information generated by the sentinel species should empower stakeholders and decision-makers to take mitigative action or support predictive capabilities; the ""utility"" of the species selected should consider its value and relevance to conservationists and to society at large (e.g., education and outreach; social sciences). wild canids may serve as excellent sentinel species of emerging canine vector-borne diseases. several canine vector-borne diseases or antibodies to these pathogens have been identified in wild canids including visceral leishmaniosis, lyme disease, heartworm, hepatozoonosis and anaplasmosis to name a few.these reports are relatively recent as they relate to wildlife-domestic animal interactions, globalisation, translocations, habitat fragmentation and climate change. these pathogens and their relationship to wild canids are described herein. further research needs to be performed to elucidate the role of the 36 extant species of wild canids in the epidemiology of canine vector-borne diseases.",A Alonso Aguirre

12473,Antibody Engineering for Pursuing a Healthier Future,"abstractsince the development of antibody-production techniques, a number of immunoglobulins have been developed on a large scale using conventional methods. hybridoma technology opened a new horizon in the production of antibodies against target antigens of infectious pathogens, malignant diseases including autoimmune disorders, and numerous potent toxins. however, these clinical humanized or chimeric murine antibodies have several limitations and complexities. therefore, to overcome these difficulties, recent advances in genetic engineering techniques and phage display technique have allowed the production of highly specific recombinant antibodies. these engineered antibodies have been constructed in the hunt for novel therapeutic drugs equipped with enhanced immunoprotective abilities, such as engaging immune effector functions, effective development of fusion proteins, efficient tumor and tissue penetration, and high-affinity antibodies directed against conserved targets. advanced antibody engineering techniques have extensive applications in the fields of immunology, biotechnology, diagnostics, and therapeutic medicines. however, there is limited knowledge regarding dynamic antibody development approaches. therefore, this review extends beyond our understanding of conventional polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. furthermore, recent advances in antibody engineering techniques together with antibody fragments, display technologies, immunomodulation, and broad applications of antibodies are discussed to enhance innovative antibody production in pursuit of a healthier future for humans.","Afuh F U H Saeed, R Wang, Ling S Wang, S "
7374,The Importance of Bacterial and Viral Infections Associated with Adult Asthma Exacerbations in Clinical Practice,"abstractviral infection is one of the risk factors for asthma exacerbation. however, which pathogens are related to asthma exacerbation in adults remains unclear.the relation between various infections and adult asthma exacerbations was investigated in clinical practice.the study subjects included 50 adult inpatients due to asthma exacerbations and 20 stable outpatients for comparison. the pathogens from a nasopharyngeal swab were measured by multiplex pcr analysis.asthma exacerbations occurred after a common cold in 48 inpatients. the numbers of patients with viral, bacterial, or both infections were 16, 9, and 9, respectively. the dominant viruses were rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and metapneumovirus. the major bacteria were s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae. compared to pathogen-free patients, the patients with pathogens were older and non-atopic and had later onset of disease, lower feno levels, lower ige titers, and a higher incidence of comorbid sinusitis, copd, or pneumonia. compared to stable outpatients, asthma exacerbation inpatients had a higher incidence of smoking and comorbid sinusitis, copd, or pneumonia. viruses were detected in 50% of stable outpatients, but a higher incidence of rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and metapneumovirus infections was observed in asthma exacerbation plos one | conclusion viral or bacterial infections were observed in 70% of inpatients with an asthma exacerbation in clinical practice. infection with s. pneumoniae was related to adult asthma exacerbation.","Motoyasu Iikura, Masayuki Hojo, Rikiya Koketsu, Sho Watanabe, Ayano Sato, Haruka Chino, Shoki Ro, Haruna Masaki, Junko Hirashima, Satoru Ishii,  Go Naka, Jin Takasaki, Shinyu Izumi, Nobuyuki Kobayashi, Sachiko Yamaguchi, Susumu Nakae, Haruhito Sugiyama"
6222,Human IFIT1 Inhibits mRNA Translation of Rubulaviruses but Not Other Members of the Paramyxoviridae Family,"abstractwe have previously shown that ifit1 is primarily responsible for the antiviral action of interferon (ifn) alpha/beta against parainfluenza virus type 5 (piv5), selectively inhibiting the translation of piv5 mrnas. here we report that while piv2, piv5, and mumps virus (muv) are sensitive to ifit1, nonrubulavirus members of the paramyxoviridae such as piv3, sendai virus (sev), and canine distemper virus (cdv) are resistant. the ifit1 sensitivity of piv5 was not rescued by coinfection with an ifit1-resistant virus (piv3), demonstrating that piv3 does not specifically inhibit the antiviral activity of ifit1 and that the inhibition of piv5 mrnas is regulated by cis-acting elements. we developed an in vitro translation system using purified human ifit1 to further investigate the mechanism of action of ifit1. while the translations of piv2, piv5, and muv mrnas were directly inhibited by ifit1, the translations of piv3, sev, and cdv mrnas were not. using purified human mrna-capping enzymes, we show biochemically that efficient inhibition by ifit1 is dependent upon a 5= guanosine nucleoside cap (which need not be n7 methylated) and that this sensitivity is partly abrogated by 2=o methylation of the cap 1 ribose. intriguingly, piv5 m mrna, in contrast to np mrna, remained sensitive to inhibition by ifit1 following in vitro 2=o methylation, suggesting that other structural features of mrnas may influence their sensitivity to ifit1. thus, surprisingly, the viral polymerases (which have 2=-o-methyltransferase activity) of rubulaviruses do not protect these viruses from inhibition by ifit1. possible biological consequences of this are discussed.citation young df, andrejeva j, li x, inesta-vaquera f, dong c, cowling vh, goodbourn s, randall re. 2016. human ifit1 inhibits mrna translation of rubulaviruses but not other members of the paramyxoviridae family. j virol 90:9446 -9456.","D F Young, J Andrejeva, X Li, F Inesta-Vaquera, C Dong, V H Cowling, S Goodbourn, R E Randall"
10696,Molecular characterization of US-like and Asian non-S INDEL strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) that circulated in Japan during 2013-2016 and PEDVs collected from recurrent outbreaks,"abstractbackground: since late 2013, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (pedv) has reemerged in japan and caused severe economic losses to the swine industry. although pedv vaccines have been used widely, the disease has swept rapidly across the county, and is commonly observed in ped-vaccinated farms, and has recurred in domestic herds. to better understand pedvs responsible for the reemerging outbreaks in japan, full-length spike (s), membrane (m), and nucleocapsid (n) genes of 45 pedvs collected in japan during 2013-2016, were sequenced and analyzed.results: phylogenetic analysis based on s gene sequences revealed that all the recent field pedvs were genetically distinct from the classical japanese strains, and were classified into three genotypes: north american (na), s indel, and asian non-s indel. our data suggested a possibility that multiple parental pedv strains were introduced into japan from abroad at the same time or similar times. the newly identified japanese strains showed the closest relationship to the us strains. two sublineages of japanese strains circulating in japan were similar to two sublineages identified in the us, suggesting common ancestors for these strains. in comparison with two vaccine strains used in japan, the field strains had various changes in epitope regions, glycosylation sites, and phosphorylation sites. these substitutions, particularly observed in epitope regions of the s (521, 553, 568, and 570), m (5), and n (123, 252, and 255) proteins, may have affected antigenicity and vaccine efficacy, resulting in an unsuccessful pedv control. sequence comparisons between pedvs collected from primary and secondary outbreaks in three herds revealed that the disease has developed to an endemic stage in which pedv could persist for nearly two years in the herds or local regions, causing subsequent epidemics.conclusions: these results elucidate the genetic characteristics, origin, and molecular epidemiology of pedvs circulating in japan, as well as the pedv strains causing recurrent outbreaks. this study provides a better insight into the pedvs responsible for recent outbreaks in japan, and could potentially help to develop measures for controlling and preventing the disease.","Nguyen Van Diep, Masuo Sueyoshi, Junzo Norimine, Takuya Hirai, Ohnmar Myint, Angeline Ping, Ping Teh, Zahli Izzati, Naoyuki Fuke, Ryoji Yamaguchi"
6349,Co-Infection of Swine with Porcine Circovirus Type 2 and Other Swine Viruses,"abstractporcine circovirus 2 (pcv2) is the etiological agent that causes porcine circovirus diseases and porcine circovirus-associated diseases (pcvd/pcvad), which are present in every major swine-producing country in the world. pcv2 infections may downregulate the host immune system and enhance the infection and replication of other pathogens. however, the exact mechanisms of pcvd/pcvad are currently unknown. to date, many studies have reported that several cofactors, such as other swine viruses or bacteria, vaccination failure, and stress or crowding, in combination with pcv2, lead to pcvd/pcvad. among these cofactors, co-infection of pcv2 with other viruses, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine parvovirus, swine influenza virus and classical swine fever virus have been widely studied for decades. in this review, we focus on the current state of knowledge regarding swine co-infection with different pcv2 genotypes or strains, as well as with pcv2 and other swine viruses.pcv2 is divided into five genotypes according to the cap gene sequence: pcv2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, and 2e . moreover, the pcv2b genotype is classified into three clusters, 1a to 1c, and the pcv2a genotype is subdivided into five clusters, 2a to 2f -24]. recently, a retrospective study of pcv2 infection between 1996 and 1999 in china revealed a novel genotype pcv2f which shared lower sequence identity with the other known genotypes . since the discovery of pcv2 in the late 1990s, the virus has continued to evolve, and two major genotype shifts have been observed. the first genotype shift in pcv2 was from pcv2a to pcv2b in 2004pcv2b in /2005. since 2012, the predominant pcv2b has been gradually replaced by the pcv2d genotype in north america, china, south korea and uruguay . besides, pcv2f becomes the predominant genotype in the pcv2a cluster in china .it has been reported that concurrent infections with different pcv2 genotypes have been detected in the same pig, resulting in inter-and intra-genotype recombination  . one hundred and eighteen pcv2-positive dna samples isolated from diseased pigs were analyzed using a modified differential polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay, and the results indicated that the coexistence rates of pcv2 genotypes were 32.2% (38/118) in sick pigs  . the sequencing results of 38 co-infected samples showed that the coexisting genotypes were pcv2a-pcv2b (12/38), pcv2a-pcv2d (15/38) and pcv2e-pcv2d (11/38)  . one group reported that the recombination rate of the pcv2 isolates was 27.7% (17/54) in the samples collected from 2006 to 2016 in china , and the recombination mainly occurred in the orf1 gene of pcv2 . furthermore, co-infections with different pcv2 genotypes may cause more serious disease. in cells infected with replicating viruses, both pcv2a and pcv2b genotypes were equally present . further studies have demonstrated that pigs with dually heterologous inoculation or naturally infected with multiple pcv2 genotypes or strains displayed more severe lesions . these results suggest that the coexistence of different strains of pcv2 might contribute to the development of more severe clinical symptoms in pigs and more recombination events between strains in the field  . therefore, more studies need to focus on analyzing the recombination trends of pcv2 strains, which may provide a better strategy for vaccine development and vaccination strategy.co-infection of pcv2 with other swine virusesporcine circovirus 3 (pcv3) is a newly emerging virus belonging to the family circoviridae, and it has a circular 2000 bp ssdna genome that mainly encodes replicase and capsid proteins . however, the sequence identity of pcv3 to pcv1 and pcv2 was only 31-48% on the amino acid level, respectively , indicating that pcv3 is distinct from pcv1 and pcv2. pcv3 was divided into three major clades (pcv3a, pcv3b and pcv3c) based on complete coding sequences . recently, other groups have found that pcv3 has a close relationship to bat circovirus . thus, it was hypothesized that pcv3 may have evolved from bats and then gradually adapted to infect pigs and other animals , which might pose a potential risk to public health due to its close relationship with bat circovirus .pcv3 can be detected in multiple tissues with different positive rates in healthy and diseased pigs , and the positive rate of pcv3 has increased gradually in sows and stillborns . surprisingly, the infection rate of pcv3 in wild boars was similar or higher than that of domestic pigs, with the infection rates of 33% to 42.66%, indicating that the wild boar is a potential reservoir for pcv3 . pcv3 has been associated with cardiac and multisystemic inflammation, prdc, pdns and reproductive failure 46], most of which are similar to that of pcvd/pcvad caused by pcv2. notably, pcv3-positive clinical samples were frequently found to be co-infected with pcv2, as the co-infection rates were 27.6-39.39% and 19.14% in pig farms and slaughter houses, respectively , suggesting mixed infection of pcv2 and pcv3 are common in pig populations. however, to date, isolation and propagation of pcv3 was unsuccessful in vitro ,","Ting Ouyang, Xinwei Zhang, Xiaohua Liu, Linzhu Ren"
10407,"GI-16 lineage (624/I or Q1), there and back again: The history of one of the major threats for poultry farming of our era","abstractthe genetic variability of infectious bronchitis virus (ibv) is one of the main challenges for its control, hindering not only the development of effective vaccination strategies but also its classification and, consequently, epidemiology understanding. the 624/i and q1 genotypes, now recognized to be part of the gi-16 lineage, represent an excellent example of the practical consequences of ibv molecular epidemiology limited knowledge. in fact, being their common origin unrecognized for a long time, independent epidemiological pictures were drawn for the two genotypes. to fix this misinterpretation, the present study reconstructs the history, population dynamics and spreading patterns of gi-16 lineage as a whole using a phylodynamic approach. a collection of worldwide available hypervariable region 1 and 2 (hvr12) and 3 (hvr3) sequences of the s1 protein was analysed together with 258 hvr3 sequences obtained from samples collected in italy (the country where this genotype was initially identified) since 1963. the results demonstrate that after its emergence at the beginning of the xx century, gi-16 was able to persist until present days in italy. approximately in the late 1980s, it migrated to asia, which became the main nucleus for further spreading to middle east, europe and especially south america, likely through multiple introduction events. a remarkable among-country diffusion was also demonstrated in asia and south america. interestingly, although most of the recent italian gi-16 strains originated from ancestral viruses detected in the same country, a couple were closely related to chinese ones, supporting a backward viral flow from china to italy. besides to the specific case-study results, this work highlights the misconceptions that originate from the lack of a unified nomenclature and poor molecular epidemiology data generation and sharing. this shortcoming appears particularly relevant since the described scenario could likely be shared by many other ibv genotypes and pathogens in general.gammacoronavirus, family coronaviridae. the viral genome is about 27 kb long and encodes for different proteins, such as the rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp), numerous accessory and regulatory proteins and the spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid structural proteins  . ibv currently represents one of the most relevant diseases of poultry farming, being responsible for respiratory signs, reproductive disorders and relevant mortality, particularly in presence of nephropathogenic strains or secondary infections  . similarly to other rna viruses, it is characterized by high evolutionary and recombination rates, which drive the rapid evolution of this pathogen and lead to a remarkable genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity  . the spike protein, further processed in the s1 and s2 sub-units, is by far the most studied viral protein because of its relevance in viral life-cycle and host interaction. besides being involved in viral attachment and viral-host membranes fusion, it is also the main target of the host neutralizing immune response  4] . its remarkable variability has several implications, the most practical one being the poor cross protection among different viral strains and genotypes  , which severely hinders the infection and disease control through vaccination. additionally, the genetic variability has also complicated the viral classification, leading to the proposal of a multitude of genotypes based on specific research studies or local investigations, in absence of shared criteria. although it could appear a mere nomenclature issue, this state of affairs had astonishing implications impeding or confusing the proper understanding of ibv molecular epidemiology.only in 2016, in the framework of cost action fa1207, a coherent and common ibv genotype classification was proposed , grouping the identified strains in 6 genotypes and 32 lineages.interestingly, valastro et al., (2016) , confirmed what previously proposed by franzo et al.,  about the clustering of 624/i (genbank accession number jq901492) and q1 genotypes in the same group in the phylogenetic tree based on the partial s1 gene (currently named gi-16). until then, the two genotypes had been named (and considered) independent: the 624/i was first reported in italy in 1993  , and thereafter in slovenia , poland , and russia  . moreover, retrospective studies demonstrated its wide circulation in italy since the early 1960s  , where it remained the most prevalent genotype for more than a decade. however, from the 1990s, its detection and reporting became sporadic or absent. at the same time, in 1996, a new ibv strain (later renamed q1) was identified in animals affected by proventriculitis  in china and thereafter in other asian  15], middle eastern  17] , south american  19] and european countries     . remarkably, not recognizing the relationship between these strains, a new spread from asia was supposed, similarly what was proven for the gi-19 lineage (qx genotype)  . data recently published by laconi et al.  strongly suggest a common origin between the 624i and q1 genotypes, however the actual origin and dispersal pattern of gi-16 lineage could not be inferred confidently.the insight provided by recent genetic studies  7] raised new questions about the history, epidemiology and spreading of the gi-16 lineage around the world. the knowledge of these processes would be of interest not only for the particular case under investigation, but could also provide useful information on the general intra-and inter-continents viral dispersion patterns, aiding the development and implementation of adequate control measures.unfortunately, the paucity of sequences available before q1 detection in china prevented this investigation for a long time. in the present study, a high number of retrospective gi-16 sequences were generated from italian samples collected since 1963 and analyzed together with the worldwide available ones using a phylodynamic approach to reconstruct the history of this lineage and infer its spreading pattern around the world. phylodynamic analysis of ibv gi-16 lineage

598,Glycosylation of Zika Virus Is Important in Host-Virus Interaction and Pathogenesis 1 USA,"abstractzika virus (zikv) is a global public health issue due to its association with severe 33 developmental disorders in infants and neurological disorders in adults. because zikv uses 34 glycosylation of its envelope (e) protein to interact with host cell receptors to facilitate entry, 35 these interactions could also be important for designing therapeutics and vaccines. due to a lack 36 of information about asn-linked (n-glycans) on zikv e, we analyzed zikv e of various strains 37 derived from different cells. zikv e proteins are extensively modified with oligomannose-, 38 hybrid-and complex-n-glycans of a highly heterogeneous nature. host cell-surface glycans 39 correlated strongly with the glycomic features of zikv e. mechanistically, we discovered that 40 zikv n-glycans are important in viral pathogenesis, as mannose-specific c-type lectins dc-41 sign and l-sign mediate cell entry of zikv. our findings represent the first detailed mapping 42 of n-glycans on zikv e of various strains and their functional significance.43 44 all rights reserved. no reuse allowed

mosquitoes, though other 46 transmission routes, such as through placenta and sexual intercourse can also occur 1,2 . recently, 47 the considerable increase in zikv infection rates has raised urgent global urgent concerns, 48 especially after the outbreaks in yap islands (2007) 3,4 , french polynesia (2013) 5,6 , easter island 49 (2014) 7 , and brazil (2015) 8,9 . these zikv outbreaks were associated with a sharp increase in 50 cases of guillain barre syndrome (gbs), an autoimmune disease featured by weakening and 51 paralysis of the limbs and face. in 2015, zika spread to south and central america, infecting 52 thousands of people in brazil and colombia, where it was associated with an increase in gbs 53 rates as well as a significant increase in severe fetal abnormalities including spontaneous 54 abortion, stillbirth, hydrocephaly, microcephaly, hydranencephaly/hydrops fetalis, and placental 55 insufficiency 10-14 . zikv is a small, enveloped positive-strand rna virus 15 . the genomic rna 56 of this mosquito-borne flavivirus contains a single open reading frame (orf) that encodes a 57 polyprotein 16,17 . this polyprotein undergoes co-and post-translational processing to produce 58 three structural proteins, which are capsid (c), pre-membrane (prm) and envelope (e), in 59 addition to seven non-structural proteins (ns1, ns2a, ns2b, ns3, ns4a, ns4b, and ns5) 17,18 . 60 of the three structural proteins, e is the major surface glycoprotein, containing three domains (i, 61 ii, iii) and two transmembrane helices 17-19 . the majority of flaviviruses e proteins are post-62 translationally modified by n-glycans at amino acid 153/154 within a highly conserved 63 glycosylation motif of n-x-t/s at positions 154-156 (where x is any amino acid except proline) 64 16 . this is a primary target of neutralizing antibodies and is required for virus entry 20 .65previously, it was demonstrated that the n-glycosylation sites on the e protein of flaviviruses are 66 highly conserved (supplementary fig. 1) , playing a vital role in both infectivity and assembly 67 all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.the copyright holder for

across the six cell lines that were tested (supplementary fig. 4a, b) . when produced in 103 c6/36, vero, thp-1, and snb19 cells, these n-glycan profiles were heavily dominated by 104 sialylated glycans. for these four cell lines, bi-and tri-sialylated tri-antennary n-glycans (3241.8 105 m/z and 3603.0 m/z) were the most abundant found on zikv e, followed by bi-sialylated bi-106 antennary (2792.5 m/z) and tetra-sialylated tri-antennary (3964.2 m/z) n-glycans 107 (supplementary fig. 4a, b) . zikv e produced in snb19 cells was also found to be decorated 108 with man5 (1579.9 m/z), agalactosylated bisected (1907.1 m/z), core-fucosylated non-sialylated 109 bi-antennary (2244.3 m/z), and core-fucosylated mono-sialylated bi-antennary (2605.5 m/z) n-110 glycans (supplementary fig. 4a, b). when expressed in the llc-mk2 and jeg-9 cell lines, the 111 n-glycan profiles of mr766 and ibh strains of e were markedly different. when produced in 112 llc-mk2 cells, bi-sialylated bi-antennary (2792.5 m/z) and core-fucosylated agalactosylated 113 (1836.0 m/z) n-glycans were by far the two most abundant glycan species (supplementary fig. 114 4a, b). more complex n-glycans, with three or more sialic acids and additional lactosamine 115 repeats, were not identified in zikv e expressed in llc-mk2 cells. finally, the zikv e 116 produced in jeg-3 cells revealed a different n-glycosylation pattern between mr766 and ibh 117 strains. while the di-and tri-sialylated n-glycans (2792.5, 3241.8, and 3603.0 m/z) were the 118 most abundant for the mr766 zikv-e produced in jeg-3, the variety of n-glycans identified in 119 jeg-3 cells was greater, notably including man 5 glcnac 2 (1579.9 m/z), man 6 glcnac 2 (1784.0 120 m/z), man 7 glcnac 2 (1988.1 m/z), man 8 glcnac 2 (2192.2 m/z), asialo bi-antennary (2070.2 121 m/z), and core fucosylated asialo-bi-antennary (2244.3 m/z) n-glycans (supplementary fig.   122 4a). in contrast, the ibh strain produced in the jeg-3 cells displayed a more restricted n-glycan 123 profile, with the notable absence of sialylated n-glycans and with the core fucosylated asialo-bi-124 all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without

7235,Antiviral activities of Schizonepeta tenuifolia Briq. against enterovirus 71 in vitro and in vivo OPEN,"abstractwe studied whether the aqueous extract of schizonepeta tenuifolia briq (ste) has antiviral activity. ste inhibited replication of ev71, as evident by its ability to diminish plaque formation and cytopathic effect induced by ev71, and to inhibit the synthesis of viral rna and protein. moreover, daily singledose ste treatment significantly improved the survival of ev71-infected mice, and ameliorated the symptoms. mechanistically, ste exerts multiple effects on enteroviral infection. treatment with ste reduced viral attachment and entry; the cleavage of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 g (eif4g) by ev71 protease, 2a pro ; virus-induced reactive oxygen species (ros) formation; and relocation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein a1 (hnrnp a1) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. it was accompanied by a decline in ev71-associated hyperphosphorylation of p38 kinase and eps15. it is plausible that ste may inhibit ros-induced p38 kinase activation, and subsequent hnrnp a1 relocation and eps15-mediated membrane trafficking in infected cells. these findings suggest that ste possesses anti-ev71 activities, and may serve as health food or candidate antiviral drug for protection against ev71.enterovirus 71 (ev71) is a non-enveloped, positive-sense single stranded rna virus belonging to the family picornaviridae, and is one of the major pathogens that causes hand, foot and mouth disease in young children, especially those under 5 years old 1 . ev71 transmits from person to person by direct contact saliva, nasal mucus, stool and blister of infected patients 2-4 . most of ev71 infections are mild and self-limiting. these infected individuals have slight fever, herpangina, and rash on the mouth, hand and body. some severe cases may progress to published: xx xx xxxx open  2 scientific reports | 7: 935 | develop aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and polio-like symptoms. the central nervous system (cns) infections can result in pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage and lung collapse 5-8 , which may be fatal to patients. the survivors of severe ev71 infections may have irreversible neural sequelae 9 . three large outbreaks of ev71 have been recorded in recent decades. in 1998, 129,106 individuals were infected, and 78 fatal cases were reported in taiwan 1 . ev71 caused 126 deaths in 2008 and 567 victims in 2012 in china 10, 11 . no antiviral drug is available for treating ev71 infection. development of a specific anti-ev71 drug may improve the clinical outcomes in infected patients.the rna genome of ev71 encodes a large precursor polypeptide that is processed by viral protease to generate viral structural proteins (vp1, vp2, vp3, and vp4) and nonstructural proteins (2a, 2b, 2c, 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d). after viral attachment to receptor, the virus is endocytosed via clathrin-coated vesicles, and uncoated to release the genomic rna. unlike cellular message rna, the viral genomic rna lacks the cap structure on 5′ end to recruit ribosome and initiate protein translation. its highly structured 5′ untranslated region (utr) contains internal ribosomal entry site (ires) which interacts with ires trans-acting factors (itafs) and facilitates the initiation of translation 12, 13 . heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein a1 (hnrnp a1) is one member of itafs and is involved in the synthesis of viral genome and protein 14, 15 . ev71 infection induces the relocation of hnrnp a1 from nucleus to cytoplasm which may be beneficial to viral replication 14 . the viral protease, 2a pro , hydrolyzes eukaryotic initiation factor 4g (eif4g) and poly(a) binding protein (pabp) that are essential for the cap-dependent translation    . the hydrolytic reactions cause the switch of cap-dependent translation to ires-dependent translation. ev71 hijacks the host translation machinery to synthesize viral proteins 18 .accumulating evidence indicates that the redox state of host may play important roles in the viral pathogenesis. the susceptibility to viruses, such as dengue virus, enterovirus 71 or coronavirus, is related to redox state of host cells     . antioxidants are known to deter viral infection. for instance, glutathione and resveratrol inhibit influenza infection in cell and animal model 23, 24 . treatment with synthetic antioxidants, such as mitotempo and n-acetyl-cysteine, and natural antioxidants, such as epigallocatechin gallate (egcg) and gallocatechin gallate (gcg), diminishes ev71 replication 20, 25, 26 . the antiviral capacity of tea polyphenols correlates with their antioxidant ability. these studies suggest that the redox state of host is an important determinant of viral susceptibility, and that the antioxidative capacity of herbal extract partly accounts for the antiviral activity.schizonepeta tenuifolia briq. (st), also called ""jing jie"" in china, is an annual plant belonging to the family labiatae. in east asia, the fresh stem and leaf of st are usually used as ingredients in several food recipes, herbal tea, beneficial drinks, medicinal cuisine, and herbal remedy 27 . spikes, stems and leaves of st are sun-dried or carbonized before use medicinally. st contains a number of bioactive constituents (supplementary table s1 ) 27-34 . st is used to treat the common cold, headaches, fever, allergic dermatitis, skin rash, and inflammatory diseases 28 . an antiviral activity is associated with st. st has been used in formulation of yinqiao-decoction, which proved effective in reduction of hemagglutinin titer of virus in lung tissue of influenza virus-infected mice 35 . however, previous reports on the anti-enteroviral activity of st extract are controversial. hsu et al. showed that a 95% ethanolic extract of st inhibits one out of four clinical isolated ev71 in a screen of anti-ev71 activity with taiwanese folk medicinal plants. in contrast, lin et al. showed that an aqueous extract of dried st has no anti-ev71 activity among 22 antipyretic and toxin-eliminating traditional chinese herbs 37 .in the present study, we demonstrate an anti-ev71 activity of ste. ste inhibits cytopathic effect, plaque formation, and genomic rna replication of ev71. moreover, it alleviates the symptoms and enhances the survival of ev71-infected mice. mechanistically, ste inhibits ev71-induced ros generation and hnrnp a1 translocation; cleavage of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4g (eif4g); and p38 kinase-mediated eps 15 phosphorylation. our findings suggest that ste exerts an antiviral activity against ev71 through its action on a number of targets.","Sin-Guang Chen, Mei-Ling Cheng, Kuan-Hsing Chen, Jim-Tong Horng, Ching-Chuan Liu, Shih-Min Wang, Hiroaki Sakurai, Yann-Lii Leu, Shulhn-Der Wang, Hung-Yao Ho"
12153,The interconnected and cross-border nature of risks posed by infectious diseases,"abstractinfectious diseases can constitute public health emergencies of international concern when a pathogen arises, acquires new characteristics, or is deliberately released, leading to the potential for loss of human lives as well as societal disruption. a wide range of risk drivers are now known to lead to and/or exacerbate the emergence and spread of infectious disease, including global trade and travel, the overuse of antibiotics, intensive agriculture, climate change, high population densities, and inadequate infrastructures, such as water treatment facilities. where multiple risk drivers interact, the potential impact of a disease outbreak is amplified. the varying temporal and geographic frequency with which infectious disease events occur adds yet another layer of complexity to the issue. mitigating the emergence and spread of infectious disease necessitates mapping and prioritising the interdependencies between public health and other sectors. conversely, during an international public health emergency, significant disruption occurs not only to healthcare systems but also to a potentially wide range of sectors, including trade, tourism, energy, civil protection, transport, agriculture, and so on. at the same time, dealing with a disease outbreak may require a range of critical sectors for support. there is a need to move beyond narrow models of risk to better account for the interdependencies between health and other sectors so as to be able to better mitigate and respond to the risks posed by emerging infectious disease.","Jonathan E Suk, Thomas Van Cangh, Julien Beauté, Cornelius Bartels, Svetla Tsolova, Anastasia Pharris, Massimo Ciotti, Jan C Semenza"
6670,Targeting deubiquitinase USP28 for cancer therapy,"abstractas one of the most important post-translational modifications, ubiquitination plays versatile roles in cancer-related pathways, and is involved in protein metabolism, cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, and transcription. counteracting the activities of the e3 ligases, the deubiquitylating enzymes have been suggested as another important mechanism to modulate the ubiquitination process, and are implicated in cancer as well. in this article, we review the emerging roles of usp28 in cancer pathways as revealed by recent studies. we discuss the major mechanisms by which usp28 is involved in the cancer-related pathways, whereby usp28 regulates physiological homeostasis of ubiquitination process, dna-damage response, and cell cycle during genotoxic stress. we further review the studies where usp28 was targeted for treating multiples cancers including non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, intestinal cancers, gliomas, and bladder cancer. as a result, the clinical significance of targeting usp28 for cancer therapy merits further exploration and demonstration.• in addition to developing pharmacological inhibitors of usp28, what are other efficient strategies of targeting usp28 that have clinical adaptability and feasibility for treating cancers?","Xiaofang Wang, Zhiyi Liu, Li Zhang, Zhaozhi Yang, Xingxing Chen, Jurui Luo, Zhirui Zhou, Xin Mei, Xiaoli Yu, Zhimin Shao, Yan Feng, Shen Fu, Zhen Zhang, Dongping Wei, Lijun Jia, Jinli Ma, Xiaomao Guo"
7736,Oxidative Stress in Poultry: Lessons from the Viral Infections,"abstractreactive species (rs), generally known as reactive oxygen species (ros) and reactive nitrogen species (rns), are produced during regular metabolism in the host and are required for many cellular processes such as cytokine transcription, immunomodulation, ion transport, and apoptosis. intriguingly, both rns and ros are commonly triggered by the pathogenic viruses and are famous for their dual roles in the clearance of viruses and pathological implications. uncontrolled production of reactive species results in oxidative stress and causes damage in proteins, lipids, dna, and cellular structures. in this review, we describe the production of rs, their detoxification by a cellular antioxidant system, and how these rs damage the proteins, lipids, and dna. given the widespread importance of rs in avian viral diseases, oxidative stress pathways are of utmost importance for targeted therapeutics. therefore, a special focus is provided on avian virus-mediated oxidative stresses. finally, future research perspectives are discussed on the exploitation of these pathways to treat viral diseases of poultry.","Zaib Ur Rehman, Chunchun Meng, Yingjie Sun, Anum Safdar, Riaz Hussain, Muhammad Munir, Chan Ding"
12128,The Interplay between Dengue Virus and the Human Innate Immune System: A Game of Hide and Seek,"abstractwith 40% of the world population at risk, infections with dengue virus (denv) constitute a serious threat to public health. while there is no antiviral therapy available against this potentially lethal disease, the efficacy of the only approved vaccine is not optimal and its safety has been recently questioned. in order to develop better vaccines based on attenuated and/or chimeric viruses, one must consider how the human immune system is engaged during denv infection. the activation of the innate immunity through the detection of viruses by cellular sensors is the first line of defence against those pathogens. this triggers a cascade of events which establishes an antiviral state at the cell level and leads to a global immunological response. however, denv has evolved to interfere with the innate immune signalling at multiple levels, hence dampening antiviral responses and favouring viral replication and dissemination. this review elaborates on the interplay between denv and the innate immune system. a special focus is given on the viral countermeasure mechanisms reported over the last decade which should be taken into consideration during vaccine development.vaccines 2019, 7, 145 2 of 21 serotypes (1-4) in one given restricted geographic area  5] . while there is an unmet medical need regarding strategies against dengue, the incidence of this disease is expected to geographically expand in the future considering that the arthropod vector is colonizing northern european and american territories with temperate climates.denv infection is characterized by a mixed clinical presentation that ranges from an asymptomatic disease to a mild febrile prodrome all the way to a severe hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. all infected individuals, asymptomatic or not, can transmit denv to aedes mosquitoes during a blood meal, making it difficult to precisely estimate the actual size of the reservoir at any given time. denv infection severity is classified according to the world health organization (who) 1997 and 2009 guidelines  . dengue ""without warning signs"" (or dengue fever) regroups at-risk individuals with fever and at least two of the following signs and symptoms: nausea/vomiting, rash, headaches, eye pain, muscle aches, joint pain, leukopenia, or positivity at the tourniquet test. dengue ""with warning signs of severe infection"" (or dengue hemorrhagic fever) includes in addition to the previous signs and symptoms abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, ascites, pleural effusion, mucosal bleeding, lethargy or restlessness, hepatomegaly, and an increase in hematocrit paired with rapid decrease in platelet count. lastly, severe dengue (or dengue shock) occurs when the infection leads to severe plasma leakage, massive bleeding, and multiple organ failures. as of now, the therapeutic arsenal against denv infection is fairly limited and only consists of supportive care and intravenous fluid therapy.from a host-pathogen interaction point of view, it is interesting to note that, in the majority of denv-infected individuals, viremia is controlled by the innate and adaptive immune systems within three to seven days, independently of the clinical manifestation  . however, in some cases, the infection is not properly handled and symptoms aggravate. a higher peak in viral titres seems to be predictive of disease severity  9] . while the pathophysiology behind severe dengue is not fully understood, it is accepted that dengue hemorrhagic fever and severe dengue result from a cytokine-mediated pathology (cytokine storm) that occurs because of the unbalanced production of various soluble and short-lived immune factors, such as tnf-α, vegf-a, il-6, il-8, il-10, ccl2, and cxcl10, that are produced by immune cells .denv is an enveloped, positive-stranded rna virus and belongs to the flavivirus genus within the flaviviridae family. flaviviruses also include genetically related and/or medically relevant arthropod-borne pathogens such as yellow fever virus (yfv), zika virus (zikv), west nile virus (wnv), and japanese encephalitis virus (jev). the enveloped virion is constituted of prm/m (precursor membrane/membrane) and e (envelope) structural proteins at the surface while c nucleocapsid protein surrounds the 11 kilobase-long non-segmented viral rna genome (vrna). following virus entry into the target cell, vrna is translated into one polyprotein, which is subsequently processed by host and viral proteases to generate the structural proteins c, prm, and e and the seven nonstructural (ns) proteins ns1, ns2a, ns2b, ns3, ns4a, ns4b, and ns5. ns proteins are responsible for vrna replication that occurs exclusively in the cytoplasm of infected cells. this involves the specific enzymatic activity of several ns proteins. the ns5 rna-dependent rna polymerase is responsible for vrna synthesis and possesses a methyltransferase activity which is absolutely required for vrna 5 capping and 2 -o-methylation. the processing of the denv polyprotein involves the serine protease activity of the ns2b/ns3 complex (or ns2b3). ns3 is also essential for vrna synthesis and capping through its helicase, ntpase, and triphosphatase activities. assembled virions bud into the endoplasmic reticulum (er) and are taken in charge by the cellular secretion machinery. in the golgi apparatus, they undergo a final round of furin-mediated maturation and acquire infectivity before their release via exocytosis    . in order to create a cytoplasmic environment that can sustain an optimal life cycle, denv, much like other flaviviruses, induces within the infected cell the biogenesis of specific vaccines 2019, 7, 145 3 of 21 membranous replication organelles or replication factories (rf) with unique morphologies  15] . these rfs are formed by altering the curvature and composition of cellular endomembranes. they have been characterized as er-derived ultrastructures that include (1) vesicle packets (vp) which result from membrane invaginations and contain the vrna replication components; (2) convoluted membranes (cm) which are enriched in ns3, ns4a, and ns4b and of which the exact role(s) remain poorly defined; and (3) virus bags which contain immature virions organized in regular arrays    . in addition, denv also manipulates the architecture of other organelles (such as mitochondria or peroxisomes) to modulate specific cellular functions, including innate immunity, in favour of replication (see below). while denv is genetically simple with only 10 viral protein expressed, its life cycle relies on highly coordinated machineries that offer various points of intervention and research interests.following the entry of the virus inside the cell, it is rapidly sensed as a foreign ""intruder"" by the cell surveillance machinery, which triggers innate immunity. strikingly, in response to these defence mechanisms, denv has evolved to efficiently hide and mask its foreign molecular signatures, hence, avoiding the establishment of an antiviral environment that is detrimental for replication. in addition to these ""cloak-and-dagger"" operations, many viral proteins are able to directly hit the host antiviral machinery to shutdown innate immune signalling. thus, antiviral immunity and denv life cycle are dynamically interconnected events which balance each other; on one hand, the virus is trying to hijack the functions of the cellular machinery to its own benefit, while, on the other hand, the host factors are trying to control the viral infection while minimizing damages to cell homeostasis.in this review, we elaborate on the interplay between denv and innate immunity. more precisely, it brings into focus how denv is detected inside an infected cell as well as how it can hide to avoid detection. a better understanding of how denv circumvents and/or attenuates innate immunity can provide critical information for rational vaccine development.","Nicolas Tremblay, Wesley Freppel, Aïssatou Aïcha Sow, Laurent Chatel-Chaix"

7881,"BMC Infectious Diseases Initial psychological responses to Influenza A, H1N1 (""Swine flu"")","abstractthe outbreak of the pandemic flu, influenza a h1n1 (swine flu) in early 2009, provided a major challenge to health services around the world. previous pandemics have led to stockpiling of goods, the victimisation of particular population groups, and the cancellation of travel and the boycotting of particular foods (e.g. pork). we examined initial behavioural and attitudinal responses towards influenza a, h1n1 (""swine flu"") in the six days following the who pandemic alert level 5, and regional differences in these responses.methods: 328 respondents completed a cross-sectional internet or paper-based questionnaire study in malaysia (n = 180) or europe (n = 148). measures assessed changes in transport usage, purchase of preparatory goods for a pandemic, perceived risk groups, indicators of anxiety, assessed estimated mortality rates for seasonal flu, effectiveness of seasonal flu vaccination, and changes in pork consumption results: 26% of the respondents were 'very concerned' about being a flu victim (42% malaysians, 5% europeans, p < .001). 36% reported reduced public transport use (48% malaysia, 22% europe, p < .001), 39% flight cancellations (56% malaysia, 17% europe, p < .001). 8% had purchased preparatory materials (e.g. face masks: 8% malaysia, 7% europe), 41% malaysia (15% europe) intended to do so (p < .001). 63% of europeans, 19% of malaysians had discussed the pandemic with friends (p < .001). groups seen as at 'high risk' of infection included the immune compromised (mentioned by 87% respondents), pig farmers (70%), elderly (57%), prostitutes/highly sexually active (53%), and the homeless (53%). in data collected only in europe, 64% greatly underestimated the mortality rates of seasonal flu, 26% believed seasonal flu vaccination gave protection against swine flu. 7% had reduced/stopped eating pork. 3% had purchased anti-viral drugs for use at home, while 32% intended to do so if the pandemic worsened.conclusion: initial responses to influenza a show large regional differences in anxiety, with malaysians more anxious and more likely to reduce travel and to buy masks and food. discussions with family and friends may reinforce existing anxiety levels. particular groups (homosexuals, prostitutes, the homeless) are perceived as at greater risk, potentially leading to increased prejudice during a pandemic. europeans underestimated mortality of seasonal flu, and require more information about the protection given by seasonal flu inoculation.","Robin Goodwin, Shamsul Haque, Felix Neto, Lynn B Myers"
11937,"Antananarivo 101, Madagascar. 6 Institut Pasteur de Madagascar","abstractunclassified morbilli-related paramyxoviruses (umrvs). a total of 947 bats were investigated originating from 52 capture sites (22 caves, 18 buildings, and 12 outdoor sites) distributed over different bioclimatic zones of the island. using rt-pcr targeting the l-polymerase gene of the paramyxoviridae family, we found that 10.5% of sampled bats were infected, representing six out of seven families and 15 out of 31 species analyzed. univariate analysis indicates that both abiotic and biotic factors may promote viral infection. using generalized linear modeling of umrv infection overlaid on biotic and abiotic variables, we demonstrate that sympatric occurrence of bats is a major factor for virus transmission. phylogenetic analyses revealed that all paramyxoviruses infecting malagasy bats are umrvs and showed little host specificity. analyses using the maximum parsimony reconciliation tool core-pa, indicate that hostswitching, rather than co-speciation, is the dominant macro-evolutionary mechanism of umrvs among malagasy bats.the transgression of the species barrier by pathogens moving from their natural host reservoir to infect a new host species (also referred to as host-switching, host-jumping or host-shifting), may induce an abortive infection in the few infected individuals of the new host, or trigger a short lived outbreak, or an epidemic 1,2 . co-speciation and host-switching are the two main evolutionary mechanisms generating genetic diversity among micro-organisms. both are long-term dynamic processes 3 , in contrast to co-evolution sensu stricto, which continuously acts on a short-time scale 4 . co-speciation, the simultaneous speciation of the host and their parasites 3,5-7 , was considered for many years as the principal macro-evolutionary process generating viral diversity     . as convincing examples of co-speciation are rare, this mechanism has probably been overestimated. host-switching refers to a new host-parasite combination that results from the shift of the parasite to a new host and its subsequent specialization, for example, under environmental selection pressure 12 . colonization by a parasite of a phylogenetically closely related host species, often of the same genus or family, has proven to be the typical macro-evolutionary mechanism for rna viruses 13 . an excellent example is the evolutionary history of hantavirus and arenavirus 14,15 , mostly shaped by multiple host-jumps, followed by adaptive processes within the new host, as demonstrated in bats and other operative host species 16, 17 .the often gregarious roosting behavior of bats and an assortment of different ecological parameters (e.g., climate, season, and migration) are important factors that can shape viral transmission dynamics, which subsequently act upon evolutionary processes 10, 11, 13, 18 . deciphering such mechanisms helps to understand how a virus hosted in wild animals can emerge as a pathogen in human populations 19 . for example, host-switching of ebola virus, sars coronavirus or nipah virus have led to major pandemics or epidemics in humans 2,20,21 .paramyxoviridae is a large and diverse viral family (order: mononegavirales) composed of single-stranded negative rna viruses 22 . newly recognized paramyxoviruses (pvs), named unclassified morbilli-related viruses (umrvs), have recently been shown to infect small mammals around the world 23 , such as bats and terrestrial small mammals from the southwestern indian ocean (swio) islands 17,24 , including the biodiversity hotspot of madagascar 25 . the island is divided into several unique bioclimatic zones, characterized by different meteorological regimes overlaid on elevation and underlying geology 26 , which in turn give rise to distinct vegetation types and highly endemic biotic communities.after rodents, bats (order chiroptera), constitute the most abundant, diversified, and geographically wide spread group of mammals in the world 27 . genetic and fossil studies have estimated the basal split of placental mammals in the superorder laurasiatheria from their ancestors at approximately 80-90 million years ago (mya) and a diversification of bat families at approximately 62 mya 28 . the chiroptera of madagascar are placed in eight different families and currently 45 species recognized, of which 36 species (80%) are endemic 29-31 ; it is assumed that most originated from africa. in certain cases, phylogenetic analyses provide evidence for recent periods of diversification. for example, malagasy miniopterus, a notably speciose genus, colonized the island from an african source population approximately between 4.5 and 2.5 mya, followed by a second phase between 2.5 and 1 mya 32 .an important characteristic of malagasy bat communities is that species co-occupy day roost sites in caves, buildings or tree cavities (often in forests) in different species combinations and varying numbers. furthermore, certain bat species may have indirect contact with other wild, introduced or domestic animals, including synanthropic small mammals, which may imply contamination of shared common water sources or fruits by bat urine/saliva 29 . considering the notable species diversity and high levels of endemism of malagasy bats, as well as varying community structure and ecological conditions in which they occur, madagascar provides an excellent context to study virus transmission in these animals. herein, we examine the factors involved in interspecific transmission of umrvs and try to unravel the macro-evolutionary mechanisms underlying genetic diversification in these viruses.","Julien Mélade, Nicolas Wieseke, Beza Ramasindrazana, Olivier Flores, Erwan Lagadec, Yann Gomard, Steven M Goodman, Koussay Dellagi, Hervé Pascalis"
5746,Virucidal activity of Garcinia parvifolia leaf extracts in animal cell culture,"abstractbackground: garcinia species contain bioactive compounds such as flavonoids, xanthones, triterpernoids, and benzophenones with antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities. in addition, many of these compounds show interesting biological properties such as anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity. garcinia parvifolia is used in traditional medicine. currently, the antiviral activity of g. parvifolia is not known.methods: this study was conducted to determine the effects of ethyl acetate (45 l ea), ethanol (45 l et), and hexane (45 l h) leaf extracts of g. parvifolia on the infectivity of pseudorabies virus (prv) in vero cells. the antiviral effects of the extracts were determined by cytopathic effect (cpe), inhibition, attachment, and virucidal assays.results: the 50% cytotoxicity concentration (cc 50 ) values obtained were 237.5, 555.0, and < 1.25 μg/ml for 45 l ea, 45 l et, and 45 l h, respectively. the 45 l ea showed the greatest viral inhibition potency of 75% at 125 μg/ml. both 45 l ea and 45 l et caused 100% residual viral inhibition at 250 μg/ml. the selectivity index values for 45 l ea, 45 l et, and 45 l h were 2.65, 1.75, and 0.10 showing that 45 l ea had the greatest antiviral activity among the three extracts. conclusion: this study showed that ethyl acetate is the best solvent to be used to obtain extract from g. parvifolia leaves with potent antiviral activities.","Aziera Adnan, Zeenathul Nazariah Allaudin, Homayoun Hani, Hwei-San Loh, Teng-Jin Khoo, Nee Kang,  Ting, Rasedee Abdullah"
6300,Correlation of cytokine level with the severity of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome,"abstractbackground: severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (sfts) was an emerging hemorrhagic fever that was caused by a tick-borne bunyavirus, sftsv. although sftsv nonstructural protein can inhibit type i interferon (ifn-i) production ex vivo and ifn-i played key role in resistance sftsv infection in animal model, the role of ifn-i in patients is not investigated. methods: we have assayed the concentration of ifn-α, a subtype of ifn-i as well as other cytokines in the sera of sfts patients and the healthy population with cba (cytometric bead array) assay.the results showed that ifn-α, tumor necrosis factor (tnf-α), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (g-csf), interferon-γ (ifn-γ), macrophage inflammatory protein (mip-1α), interleukin-6 (il-6), il-10, interferon-inducible protein (ip-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein (mcp-1) were significantly higher in sfts patients than in healthy persons (p < 0.05); the concentrations of ifn-α, ifn-γ, g-csf, mip-1α, il-6, and ip-10 were significant higher in severe sfts patients than in mild sfts patients (p < 0.05). conclusion: the concentration of ifn-α as well as other cytokines (ifn-γ, g-csf, mip-1α, il-6, and ip-10) is correlated with the severity of sfts, suggesting that type i interferon may not be significant in resistance sftsv infection in humans and it may play an import role in cytokine storm.","Miao-Miao Liu, Xiao-Ying Lei, Hao Yu, Jian-Zhi Zhang, Xue-Jie Yu"
9054,Upsurge of Enterovirus D68 and Circulation of the New Subclade D3 and Subclade B3 in Beijing OPEN,"abstractbeijing, china from 2015 to 2017. nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum were collected from 30 sentinel hospitals in beijing and subjected to ev and ev-d68 detection by real-time pcr. the vp1 gene region and complete genome sequences of ev-d68 positive cases were analyzed. of 21816 arti cases, 619 (2.84%) were ev positive and 42 cases were ev-d68 positive. the detection rates of ev-d68 were 0 (0/6644) in 2015, 0.53% (40/7522) in 2016 and 0.03% (2/7650) in 2017, respectively. two peaks of ev-d68 infections occurred in late summer and early-winter. ten cases (23.81%) with upper respiratory tract infection and 32 cases (76.19%) presented with pneumonia, including 3 cases with severe pneumonia. the phylogenetic analysis suggested 15 subclade d3 strains and 27 subclade b3 strains of ev-d68 were circulated in china from 2016 to 2017. a total of 52 amino acid polymorphisms were identified between subclades d1 and d3. these data suggest an upsurge of ev-d68 occurred in beijing in 2016, the new subclade d3 emerged in 2016 and co-circulated with subclade b3 between 2016 and 2017.enteroviruses (ev) are small, non-enveloped viruses with a single-stranded, positive-sense rna in the family picornaviridae 1,2 . the length of enteroviruses is approximately 7.5 kilobases, and divided into 15 species (ev-a to l and rhinovirus a to c) 3-6 . seven species, including ev-a to d and rhinovirus (rv) a to c, caused a wide spectrum of diseases in human 7,8 .enterovirus d68 (ev-d68), a member of the species ev-d, was first identified from bronchiolitis and pneumonia in california in 1962 9 . ev-d68 infections have been rarely reported until the worldwide outbreaks 10-18 . a nationwide outbreak of ev-d68 associated with severe respiratory tract infection was reported in the usa from mid-august 2014 to january 15, 2015 and 1,153 cases were confirmed with clinical characteristics of patients mainly resembling pneumonia with severe dyspnea syndrome during this epidemic 19 . in china, sporadic cases of ev-d68 were reported between 2006 and 2014 13,20-23 . the similar results were found that few patients confirmed with ev-d68 infections during the surveillance among us 24 , china 21 in 2015. however, an upsurge of ev-d68 infections occurred in 2016, ranging from europe to north america, including netherlands, france, sweden and united states 24-27 . in addition, sporadic cases have been reported in hong kong, italy, germany, portugal and uk in 2016 28, 29 .earlier phylogenetic analysis revealed that ev-d68 strains circulating worldwide during 1961-2013 were divided into three clades (clades a to c) or lineages (lineages 1 to 3) 10,11,29-31 . with the deepening of the study, the clades of ev-d68 were further refined. after the outbreak of the united states in 2014, ev-d68 was grouped into four clades and five subclades, including clade a, clade b (subclades b1 to b3), clade c and clade d (subclades d1 to d2) 32,33 . the subclade b1 and b3, as the major subclade, circulated around the world in 2014 and in 2016, respectively.to raise awareness of this upsurge of ev-d68 infection, we performed an ev-d68 surveillance study on arti cases from the respiratory virus surveillance system (rvss) in beijing and analyzed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of ev-d68 infections from 2015 to 2017 in beijing.resultsa total of 21, 816 arti cases were collected from rvss from january 2015 to december 2017. the median age of them was 36 years old (range: 1 day to 101 years). among 21, 816 cases, 619 (2.84%) cases were enterovirus positive and 42 (0.19%) cases were ev-d68 positive. 359 cases were successfully amplified among 619 enterovirus positive cases, including 326 cases belonging to ev-a to d, 26 cases and 7 cases belonging to rv-a and rv-c respectively, and no case belonging to rv-b. of 326 cases belonging to ev-a to d, they were genotyped to 30 serotypes including 9 of ev-a, 16 of ev-b, 4 of ev-c and 1 of ev-d and the dominant serotypes were cva6, ev-d68, cva4, cva2, cva10, cva5 and cva12, accounting for 16.27%, 12.88%, 11.83%, 11.54%, 8.28%, 5.62% and 5.03%, respectively (fig. 1) . no samples of ev-d68 co-infected with other enteroviruses were found.the annual detection rates of ev-d68 were 0 (0/6, 644) in 2015, 0.53% (40/7, 522) in 2016 and 0.03% (2/7, 650) in 2017, respectively (table 1) . twenty cases were aged younger than 18 years, 15 were aged 18 to 60 years and 7 were aged over 60 years. no statistically significant difference of ev-d68 positive rates was identified in the different age groups in 2016 (p = 0.062). statistical analysis. the differences of ev-d68 positive cases among different age groups were performed using chi-square test. the comparison of ev-d68 different subclades proportions in different age groups were performed using fisher's exact test. the comparison of respiratory diseases by different subclades of ev-d68 were performed using fisher's exact test. a two-sided p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. all analyses were performed using spss software, version 17.0.","Lingyu Shen, Cheng Gong, Zichun Xiang, Tiegang Zhang, Maozhong Li, Aihua Li, Ming Luo, Fang Huang"
6438,Review of global sanitation development,"abstractthe implementation of the united nations (un) millennium development goals (mdgs) and sustainable development goals (sdgs) has resulted in an increased focus on developing innovative, sustainable sanitation techniques to address the demand for adequate and equitable sanitation in low-income areas. we examined the background, current situation, challenges, and perspectives of global sanitation. we used bibliometric analysis and word cluster analysis to evaluate sanitation research from 1992 to 2016 based on the science citation index expanded (sci-expanded) and social sciences citation index (ssci) databases. our results show that sanitation is a comprehensive field connected with multiple categories, and the increasing number of publications reflects a strong interest in this research area. most of the research took place in developed countries, especially the usa, although sanitation problems are more serious in developing countries. innovations in sanitation techniques may keep susceptible populations from contracting diseases caused by various kinds of contaminants and microorganisms. hence, the hygienization of human excreta, resource recovery, and removal of micropollutants from excreta can serve as effective sustainable solutions. commercialized technologies, like composting, anaerobic digestion, and storage, are reliable but still face challenges in addressing the links between the political, social, institutional, cultural, and educational aspects of sanitation. innovative technologies, such as microbial fuel cells (mfcs), microbial electrolysis cells (mecs), and struvite precipitation, are at the trl (technology readiness levels) 8 level, meaning that they qualify as ""actual systems completed and qualified through test and demonstration."" solutions that take into consideration economic feasibility and all the different aspects of sanitation are required. there is an urgent demand for holistic solutions considering government support, social acceptability, as well as technological reliability that can be effectively adapted to local conditions.","Xiaoqin Zhou, Zifu Li, Tianlong Zheng, Yichang Yan, Pengyu Li, Emmanuel Alepu Odey, Heinz Peter Mang, Sayed Mohammad, Nazim Uddin"
12580,The Identification and Characterization of Two Novel Epitopes on the Nucleocapsid Protein of the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus OPEN,"abstractporcine epidemic diarrhea virus (pedv) is a highly contagious coronavirus that causes severe diarrhea and death, particularly in neonatal piglets. the nucleocapsid protein (n protein) of pedv presents strong immunogenicity and contributes to the cross-reactivity between pedv and tgev. however, the characterization of epitopes on the pedv n protein remains largely unknown. here, two monoclonal antibodies (mabs) specific to the n protein of a pedv strain, fjzz1/2011, were generated and screened against a partially overlapping library of 24 gst-fusion n protein-truncated constructs. we confirmed that residues 18-133 (designated nep-d4) and residues 252-262 (designated nep-d6) were the epitopes targeted by mabs pn-d4 and pn-d6, respectively. sequence analysis revealed that these two epitopes were highly conserved among pedv strains but were significantly different from other members of the coronavirinae subfamily. western blot analysis showed that they could be specifically recognized by pedv antisera but could not be recognized by tgev hyperimmune antisera. indirect immunofluorescence (ifa) assays confirmed no cross-reaction between these two mabs and tgev. in addition, the freeze-thaw cycle and protease treatment results indicated that nep-d4 was intrinsically disordered. all these results suggest that these two novel epitopes and their cognate mabs could serve as the basis for the development of precise diagnostic assays for pedv.porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (pedv) is a member of the genus alphacoronavirus, which belongs to the family coronaviridae in the order nidovirales. the genome of this single-stranded, positive-sense rna virus encodes, from 5′ to 3′ , the replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1b, spike (s) protein, orf3 accessory protein, envelope (e) protein, membrane (m) protein and nucleocapsid (n) protein 1-3 . the typical clinical signs of pedv infection include watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. porcine epidemic diarrhea (ped) was first reported in england in 1971 and then in many other european and asian countries in the following 30 years. with the advent of live attenuated vaccines, acute outbreaks became rare in both europe and asia during 2000-2006 4-8 . since 2007, however, pedv has re-emerged and spread across the globe, reaching asia (thailand, vietnam, japan, and china), europe (germany, spain, belgium, france, and portugal), north america (us, mexico, and canada), and australia. these outbreaks were characterized by high morbidity (80-100%) and mortality (50-90%) among suckling piglets 9-23 , causing substantial financial losses to the domestic swine industry. the severity of these epidemics emphasizes the importance of establishing effective disease control and prevention systems worldwide 24 , which will largely depend on well-validated diagnostics tests and vaccinations for pedv.the coronavirus n protein binds viral rna and is involved in several of the biological activities of the virus 25,26 . previous studies have shown that pedv n protein is responsible for viral nucleolar localization, host cycle er stress, s-phase prolongation, up-regulation of interleukin-8 expression and inhibition of interferon-β production 27-29 . in addition, pedv n protein is highly conserved. large amounts of pedv n protein can be detected in virus-infected cells, and abundant antibodies against n protein could be induced at the early stage of pedv infection 30, 31 . such features of the n protein make it an ideal target antigen for pedv diagnosis 32 , emphasizing the importance of characterizing the epitopes of pedv n protein and their related mabs. previous research on this issue has been scarce. to our knowledge, only one mab specific to pedv n protein has been reported so far, with little information regarding its corresponding epitope and whether it could cross-react with tgev n protein 33 . more detailed research aimed at characterizing pedv n protein epitopes is urgently needed.acute diarrhea caused by pedv is clinically difficult to distinguish from disease caused by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev). therefore, pedv infection cannot be diagnosed on the basis of clinical findings alone, and laboratory tests are necessary for an etiological diagnosis 34 . presently, the most commonly used diagnostic methods are reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and real-time pcr, both of which have a high efficiency and reliability in detecting viral genetic materials in fecal and intestinal samples. in addition, immunofluorescence assays (ifas), electron microscopy (em), immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisas), immunochromatography assays and fluorescent microsphere immunoassays (fmias) have been widely used to diagnose pedv infection            . among these methods, elisa has the greatest potential for clinical diagnosis on a large scale and the greatest significance for the effective detection and control of pedv, especially in developing countries, where few pig farms are equipped with qualified laboratories for complicated molecular diagnoses. however, the previously established method of indirect elisa used either the viral proteins extracted from pedv-infected vero cells or recombinant n protein generated in escherichia coli as coating antigens; in some documented das-elisa methods, the specificity of the capture and detection antibodies was unclear 40, 41, 46 . furthermore, in a recent study, researchers observed the cross-reactivity between pedv and pig tgev antisera. they also inferred that one or more epitopes on the n protein could be the contributing factors 47 . these findings called into question the accuracy of current elisa methods. to establish more reliable serodiagnostic methods for pedv, it is important to generate mabs that bind only to pedv n protein and to map which of their corresponding epitopes that can be recognized by pedv pig antisera alone.most proteins carry out biological functions based on their unique and stable three-dimensional structures. however, studies in recent decades have reported an increasing number of proteins that are fully (intrinsically disordered proteins, idps) or partially (intrinsically disordered regions, idrs) unfolded or disordered under normal physiological conditions yet remain active and functional     . moreover, the essential roles of idps/idrs in the protein interaction network, including cell signaling, transcription, translation, and the cell cycle, have been confirmed 50,52-54 . in particular, disorder abundance can be predicted and observed in viral proteins 55,56 . the unstable structures of idps/idrs make it difficult for the immune system to recognize the viral epitopes, eliciting a poor immune response from the host. partially or wholly unfolded viral proteins can also quickly adapt to and survive in the host environment due to the very high mutation rates of viral genomes 57,58 . moreover, idps, as important components of antigens, are abundant in several pathogenic organisms 59,60 . disordered epitopes are distinct and specific, and they efficiently interact with their cognate antibodies 60,61 . studies have demonstrated that the molecular mechanism by which idps function is closely associated with the transition from the disordered to the folded state upon binding with their partners, which could be proteins, dna, rna or membranes 51,62,63 . however, a similar phenomenon in terms of the recognition of disordered epitopes by antibodies has not yet been reported. studies on sars have demonstrated that idrs comprise the flexible linker between the n-terminal domain (ntd) and c-terminal domain (ctd) in n protein and have rna-binding abilities 64 . however, little attention has been paid to characterizing other intrinsically disordered epitopes of coronaviruses.to better understand the characterization of epitopes on pedv n protein, in this study, two mabs against n protein (pn-d4 and pn-d6) were generated, and their corresponding epitopes (nep-d4 and nep-d6) were identified and characterized. further analysis based on sequence alignment, ifa and western blotting showed the conservation, specificity and immunogenicity of nep-d4 and nep-d6. we also demonstrated that both nep-d4 and nep-d6 failed to result in cross-reactivity between pedv and tgev. thus, these two mabs (pn-d4 and pn-d6) and their corresponding epitopes (nep-d4 and nep-d6) could be theoretically applied to clinically accessible diagnostic assays for pedv. in addition, genesilico metadisorder and phyre2 3d structure prediction, freeze-thaw cycle analysis, and treatment with trypsin and dtt all indicated that nep-d4 is probably an intrinsically disordered protein. based on these findings, we speculated that the folding following the binding effect might be the factor behind the recognition of nep-d4 by pn-d4. this finding has not been previously reported but might warrant further investigation aimed at better understanding the mechanism by which a disordered epitope combines with its cognate antibody.resultsto generate mabs specific to the pedv n protein, we immunized balb/c mice with the purified pedv strain fjzz1/2011. we acquired hybridoma cells by fusing sp20 cells and the spleen cells from immunized mice. next, the hybridoma cell lines that survived culture in hat and ht media were screened by ifa against the pedv strain fjzz1/2011. we obtained six positive clones (f21-f3, f31-f3, f31-d4, f31-g4, f31-d6 and f42-g4) that were specific to pedv (fig. 1a) . we then examined which mabs could detect the gst-tagged recombinant n protein using indirect elisa. f31-d4 and f31-d6 exhibited a positive color, whereas f21-f3, f31-f3, f31-g4 and f42-g4 were negative (fig. 1b) . we designated the mabs secreted by hybridomas f31-d4 and f31-d6 as pn-d4 and pn-d6, respectively. the results suggested that mabs pn-d4 and pn-d6 are specific to pedv n protein. oh851 usa","Kang Wang, Chun Xie, Jianan Zhang, Wenchao Zhang, Deqiang Yang, Lingxue Yu, Yifeng Jiang, Shen Yang, Fei Gao, Zhibiao Yang, Yanjun Zhou, Guangzhi Tong"
11229,E3 Ligase ITCH Interacts with the Z Matrix Protein of Lassa and Mopeia Viruses and Is Required for the Release of Infectious Particles,"abstractlassa virus (lasv) and mopeia virus (mopv) are two closely related, rodent-born mammarenaviruses. lasv is the causative agent of lassa fever, a deadly hemorrhagic fever endemic in west africa, whereas mopv is non-pathogenic in humans. the z matrix protein of arenaviruses is essential to virus assembly and budding by recruiting host factors, a mechanism that remains partially defined. to better characterize the interactions involved, a yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted using the z proteins from lasv and mopv as a bait. the cellular proteins itch and wwp1, two members of the nedd4 family of hect e3 ubiquitin ligases, were found to bind the z proteins of lasv, mopv and other arenaviruses. the ppxy late-domain motif of the z proteins is required for the interaction with itch, although the e3 ubiquitin-ligase activity of itch is not involved in z ubiquitination. the silencing of itch was shown to affect the replication of the old-world mammarenaviruses lasv, mopv, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (lcmv) and to a lesser extent lujo virus (lujv). more precisely, itch was involved in the egress of virus-like particles and the release of infectious progeny viruses. thus, itch constitutes a novel interactor of lasv and mopv z proteins that is involved in virus assembly and release.viruses 2020, 12, 49 2 of 20 arenavirus complex known to cause vhf includes lassa virus (lasv) and the recently discovered lujo virus (lujv)  4] . the prototypic arenavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (lcmv), which is distributed worldwide, is also of clinical significance  . the most prevalent pathogen among the arenaviruses is lasv, the causative agent of lassa fever (lf), which is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, with tens of thousands of cases annually and thousands of fatalities in west africa  . the disease is characterized by acute forms associated with fever, myalgia, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, cough, sore throat, and facial edema and evolves toward a shock syndrome in the terminal stage for severe cases. the tendency of lasv to cause outbreaks has steadily risen in nigeria over the last three years, with laboratory-confirmed cases increasing from 106 in 2016 to 143 in 2017 and reaching 562 by november 2018  . additionally, there is currently no licensed vaccine or efficient antiviral drug available in the field against this disease, for which the area of endemicity is expanding  . the particularity of arenaviruses is the presence of non-pathogenic agents that are not associated with human disease, despite their isolation from the same host species. this is true for mopeia virus (mopv), which is closely related to lasv but has never been associated to human infection . mopv has even been shown to protect non-human primates against a challenge with lasv, showing that both viruses are antigenically related. comparing lasv and mopv should therefore allow the identification of immune and viral features involved in lf pathogenesis and, to a lesser extent, other arenavirus-associated vhfs.the bi-segmented rna genome of the arenaviridae family encodes four proteins: the nucleoprotein (np), the surface glycoprotein precursor (gpc), the l polymerase, and the ring finger protein z  11] . although it is the smallest arenavirus protein, the z matrix protein plays multiple functions in the viral life cycle, including structural and non-structural roles. the z protein is known to regulate key host-cell functions through direct interactions to favor viral replication. these cellular factors include the promyelocytic leukemia protein (pml), the nuclear fraction of the ribosomal protein p0, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e (eif4e), and the proline-rich homeodomain protein (prh)    . the z protein may also be involved in viral escape from the innate immune response  16] . previous studies have also revealed an inhibitory effect of the z protein on both transcription and replication using a lcmv reverse genetic system  . in addition to its non-structural roles, the z protein plays a critical role in viral assembly by mediating the incorporation of gp, np, and the l polymerase into nascent virions         . importantly, the z proteins of lasv and lcmv contain a ppxy late domain that is known, as for enveloped viruses, to mediate viral budding through the recruitment of the escrt-associated protein tsg101 and alix  26] . the lasv z ppxy motif has also been shown to interact with nedd4, from the nedd4 family of hect e3 ligases and this interaction may be required for efficient budding of the virus, as has been shown during various viral infections        . overall, the arenavirus z protein is central in the viral life cycle and interacts with a variety of cellular factors that may have been only partially discovered and are not yet fully understood.we addressed this potential knowledge gap by screening the z proteins from non-pathogenic mopv and pathogenic lasv z protein interactions using high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screening (y2h). twenty-four host-cell partners were identified and validated in a secondary y2h assay, including two nedd4-family proteins, itch and wwp1. we therefore focused on the functional role of these proteins during non-pathogenic mopv and pathogenic lcmv, lasv, and lujv infections. we observed that itch was required for the replication of tested viruses, and confirmed with other techniques the interaction of itch with the z proteins of different arenaviruses. we showed that the interaction of mopv and lasv z with itch occurred through their

4898,A Novel Bacterium-Like Particle-Based Vaccine Displaying the SUDV Glycoprotein Induces Potent Humoral and Cellular Immune Responses in Mice,"abstractsudan virus (sudv) causes severe lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates. the most effective and economical way to protect against sudan ebolavirus disease is prophylactic vaccination. however, there are no licensed vaccines to prevent sudv infections. in this study, a bacterium-like particle (blp)-based vaccine displaying the extracellular domain of the sudv glycoprotein (egp) was developed based on a gram-positive enhancer matrix-protein anchor (gem-pa) surface display system. expression of the recombinant gem-displayed egp (egp-pa-gem) was verified by western blotting and immunofluorescence assays. the sudv blps (sblps), which were mixed with montanide isa 201vg plus poly (i:c) combined adjuvant, could induce high sudv gp-specific igg titers of up to 1:40,960 and robust virus-neutralizing antibody titers reached 1:460. the sblp also elicited t-helper 1 (th1) and t-helper 2 (th2) cell-mediated immunity. these data indicate that the sblp subunit vaccine has the potential to be developed into a promising candidate vaccine against sudv infections. viruses 2019, 11, 1149 2 of 15 and receiving unprecedented attention worldwide . unfortunately, an evd outbreak occurred again in 2018 in eastern democratic republic of congo and, as of august 2019, a total of 2997 evd cases had been reported, including 2892 confirmed cases with 1998 deaths (overall case fatality rate of 67%) . since the first outbreak was reported in 1976, five different species of ebolaviruses, including ebola virus (ebov), sudan virus (sudv), reston virus (restv), bundibugyo virus (bdbv), and taï forest virus (tafv,) have been identified and their genomic sequences differ by~35-45% . excluding ebov, sudv has the highest mortality and outbreak rates among the species of ebolaviruses. sudv has emerged at least six times with average mortality rates of up to 53.76%  7] . multiple vaccines and monoclonal antibodies against ebov have been developed, but very few of them can effectively prevent and control sudv infection  . therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a safe and efficacious vaccine against sudv.the ebov genome encodes nine structural proteins, including the surface envelope glycoprotein (gp) as the only membrane protein  . the mature gp protein forms homotrimers on the surface of infected cells and virions, which is crucial for receptor binding, viral entry, and host immunity induction, making gp an ideal vaccine target  . a number of candidate vaccines for ebov have demonstrated protection against lethal ebov challenge in animal models and progressed to clinical trials, and most of these vaccines, including dna vaccines , vaccines based on viral vectors, such as recombinant adenovirus  and vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) , and protein-based vaccines, such as virus-like particles (vlps) , have been based on gp. most notably, a number of the candidate vaccines currently under clinical phase evaluation are viral vector-based vaccines  16] . while recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rvsv)-based and recombinant adenovirus type-5 vector (rad5)-based ebov candidate vaccines have been shown to be highly efficacious against ebov infection and transmission, numerous side effects, such as fever, acute arthritis, and skin lesions, have been reported  17, 18] . in addition, preexisting antibodies, costs, and side effects should also be considered. in contrast, ebov subunit vaccines may offer a relatively safe alternative for inducing immune responses against an antigen of interest  20] . however, ebov subunit vaccines would face hurdles related to immunogenicity, thus requiring selection of the antigen delivery vector and an appropriate adjuvant or even adjuvant combinations  .displaying heterologous pathogen-derived proteins on the surface of bacteria is an effective and safe way to enhance the immunogenicity of a vaccine  . gram-positive enhancer matrix-protein anchor (gem-pa), a novel surface display system, has a wide range of biotechnological applications, especially in the development of vaccine delivery systems  . the gem-pa surface display system consist of gem particles based on nonliving and nongenetically modified gram-positive lactococcus lactis (l. lactis) bacteria and a pa derived from the l. lactis peptidoglycan hydrolase acma  . antigens fused with the pa can be anchored effectively and stably to the peptidoglycan of gem particles and induce antigen-specific immune responses  . furthermore, a vaccine approach based on the gem-pa surface display system eliminates the risk of including recombinant dna in the vaccine  25] . as a safe, effective, inexpensive, multifunctional platform with a high loading capacity for protein antigens, the gem-pa surface display system has been applied to a middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus vaccine , a respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, and porcine circovirus type 2 vaccines , among others.in this study, we developed a novel bacterium-like particle (blp) vaccine displaying the sudv glycoprotein by using the gem-pa surface display system.","Shengnan Xu, Cuicui Jiao, Hongli Jin, Wujian Li, Entao

2928,Protective Effect and Mechanism of Alprostadil in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Induced by Oleic Acid in Rats,"abstractthis study investigated the role and mechanism of alprostadil in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) induced by oleic acid (oa) in rats.sprague-dawley rats were randomly divided into control, oa model, and oa + alprostadil (2.5, 5, and 10 μg/kg, respectively) groups. the ards model was induced by femoral vein injection of oa, and alprostadil was administrated immediately. lung injury was evaluated by lung wet-dry weight ratio (w/d) and histological analyses. expressions of ace, inflammatory mediators, apoptotic-related proteins, and proteins in the mapks and nf-kb signaling pathways were determined by western blot or immunohistochemical staining.compared with the control group, the oa model group had significantly increased w/d, lung injury score, and collagen deposition at 3 h after oa injection. however, alprostadil (10 μg/kg) treatment significantly reduced oa-induced elevation of these indicators. additionally, oa-induced expression of tnf-a and il-1b were suppressed by alprostadil. the oa-induced activation of nuclear factor (nf) kb p65 was also reduced by alprostadil. furthermore, we found that alprostadil had an inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of jnk, erk1/2, and p38 mapks. alprostadil inhibited bax but increased bcl-2, indicating a suppressive role in apoptosis. remarkably increased expression of ace in the oa model group was observed, which was decreased by alprostadil.alprostadil has a protective effect on ards induced by oa in rats, possibly through inhibiting apoptosis, suppressing the activation of mapks and nf-kb signaling pathways, and decreasing ace protein expression. therefore, the use of alprostadil in clinical ards treatment is promising.","E , Xiujuan Yan, Yingxiu Li, Yun Ho Choi, Chongyang Wang, B , Yihua Piao, Jing Ye, Jingzhi Jiang, F , Liangchang Li, Huixian Xu, D , Qingsong Cui, A G , Guanghai Yan, Minggen Jin"
2210,Analysis of Ebola Virus Entry Into Macrophages,"abstractebolaviruses constitute a public health threat, particularly in central and western africa. host cell factors required for spread of ebolaviruses may serve as targets for antiviral intervention. lectins, tam receptor tyrosine kinases (tyro3, axl, mer), t cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain (tim) proteins, integrins, and niemann-pick c1 (npc1) have been reported to promote entry of ebolaviruses into certain cellular systems. however, the factors used by ebolaviruses to invade macrophages, major viral targets, are poorly defined. here, we show that mannose-specific lectins, tim-1 and axl augment entry into certain cell lines but do not contribute to ebola virus (ebov)-glycoprotein (gp)-driven transduction of macrophages. in contrast, expression of mer, integrin αv, and npc1 was required for efficient gp-mediated transduction and ebov infection of macrophages. these results define cellular factors hijacked by ebov for entry into macrophages and, considering that mer and integrin αv promote phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, support the concept that ebov relies on apoptotic mimicry to invade target cells.","Franziska Dahlmann, Nadine Biedenkopf, Anne Babler, Willi Jahnen-Dechent, Christina B Karsten, Kerstin Gnirß, Heike Schneider, Florian Wrensch, Christopher A O&apos;callaghan, Stephanie Bertram, Georg Herrler, Stephan Becker, Stefan Pöhlmann, Heike Hofmann-Winkler, Henry "

6826,Congenital Malaria in China,"abstractbackground: congenital malaria, in which infants are directly infected with malaria parasites from their mother prior to or during birth, is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs at relatively low rates in malariaendemic regions. it is recognized as a serious problem in plasmodium falciparum-endemic sub-saharan africa, where recent data suggests that it is more common than previously believed. in such regions where malaria transmission is high, neonates may be protected from disease caused by congenital malaria through the transfer of maternal antibodies against the parasite. however, in low p. vivax-endemic regions, immunity to vivax malaria is low; thus, there is the likelihood that congenital vivax malaria poses a more significant threat to newborn health. malaria had previously been a major parasitic disease in china, and congenital malaria case reports in chinese offer valuable information for understanding the risks posed by congenital malaria to neonatal health. as most of the literature documenting congenital malaria cases in china are written in chinese and therefore are not easily accessible to the global malaria research community, we have undertaken an extensive review of the chinese literature on this subject.here, we reviewed congenital malaria cases from three major searchable chinese journal databases, concentrating on data from 1915 through 2011. following extensive screening, a total of 104 cases of congenital malaria were identified. these cases were distributed mainly in the eastern, central, and southern regions of china, as well as in the low-lying region of southwest china. the dominant species was p. vivax (92.50%), reflecting the malaria parasite species distribution in china. the leading clinical presentation was fever, and other clinical presentations were anaemia, jaundice, paleness, diarrhoea, vomiting, and general weakness. with the exception of two cases, all patients were cured with antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine, quinine, artemether, and artesunate.the symptoms of congenital malaria vary significantly between cases, so clear and early diagnosis is difficult. we suggest that active surveillance might be necessary for neonates born to mothers with a history of malaria.","Zhi-Yong Tao, Qiang Fang, Xue Liu, Richard Culleton, Li Tao, Hui Xia, Qi Gao"
2347,"Essay Problem-and Case-Based Learning in Science: An Introduction to Distinctions, Values, and Outcomes","abstractcase-based learning and problem-based learning have demonstrated great promise in reforming science education. yet an instructor, in newly considering this suite of interrelated pedagogical strategies, faces a number of important instructional choices. different features and their related values and learning outcomes are profiled here, including: the level of student autonomy; instructional focus on content, skills development, or nature-of-science understanding; the role of history, or known outcomes; scope, clarity, and authenticity of problems provided to students; extent of collaboration; complexity, in terms of number of interpretive perspectives; and, perhaps most importantly, the role of applying versus generating knowledge.",Douglas Allchin
8054,T Cell-Derived IL-10 Impairs Host Resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection,"abstracttuberculosis (tb), caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, causing ∼1.5 million deaths annually. cd4 + t cells and several cytokines, such as the th1 cytokine ifn-g, are critical in the control of this infection. conversely, the immunosuppressive cytokine il-10 has been shown to dampen th1 cell responses to m. tuberculosis infection impairing bacterial clearance. however, the critical cellular source of il-10 during m. tuberculosis infection is still unknown. using il-10 reporter mice, we show in this article that during the first 14 d of m. tuberculosis infection, the predominant cells expressing il-10 in the lung were ly6c + monocytes. however, after day 21 postinfection, il-10-expressing t cells were also highly represented. notably, mice deficient in t cell-derived il-10, but not mice deficient in monocyte-derived il-10, showed a significant reduction in lung bacterial loads during chronic m. tuberculosis infection compared with fully il-10-competent mice, indicating a major role for t cell-derived il-10 in tb susceptibility. il-10-expressing cells were detected among both cd4 + and cd8 + t cells, expressed high levels of cd44 and tbet, and were able to coproduce ifn-g and il-10 upon ex vivo stimulation. furthermore, during m. tuberculosis infection, il10 expression in cd4 + t cells was partially regulated by both il-27 and type i ifn signaling. together, our data reveal that, despite the multiple immune sources of il-10 during m. tuberculosis infection, activated effector t cells are the major source accounting for il-10-induced tb susceptibility."," Lú Cia Moreira-Teixeira, Paul S Redford, Evangelos Stavropoulos, Nico Ghilardi, Craig L Maynard, Casey T Weaver, Ana Paula Freitas Do Rosário, Xuemei Wu, Jean Langhorne, Anne O&apos;garra"

7552,BMC Public Health Designing and conducting tabletop exercises to assess public health preparedness for manmade and naturally occurring biological threats,"abstractbackground: since 2001, state and local health departments in the united states (us) have accelerated efforts to prepare for high-impact public health emergencies. one component of these activities has been the development and conduct of exercise programs to assess capabilities, train staff and build relationships. this paper summarizes lessons learned from tabletop exercises about public health emergency preparedness and about the process of developing, conducting, and evaluating them.we developed, conducted, and evaluated 31 tabletop exercises in partnership with state and local health departments throughout the us from 2003 to 2006. participant self evaluations, after action reports, and tabletop exercise evaluation forms were used to identify aspects of the exercises themselves, as well as public health emergency responses that participants found more or less challenging, and to highlight lessons learned about tabletop exercise design.results: designing the exercises involved substantial collaboration with representatives from participating health departments to assure that the scenarios were credible, focused attention on local preparedness needs and priorities, and were logistically feasible to implement. during execution of the exercises, nearly all health departments struggled with a common set of challenges relating to disease surveillance, epidemiologic investigations, communications, command and control, and health care surge capacity. in contrast, performance strengths were more varied across participating sites, reflecting specific attributes of individual health departments or communities, experience with actual public health emergencies, or the emphasis of prior preparedness efforts.the design, conduct, and evaluation of the tabletop exercises described in this report benefited from collaborative planning that involved stakeholders from participating health departments and exercise developers and facilitators from outside the participating agencies. while these exercises identified both strengths and vulnerabilities in emergency preparedness, additional work is needed to develop reliable metrics to gauge exercise performance, inform follow-up action steps, and to develop reevaluation exercise designs that assess the impact of post-exercise interventions.","David J Dausey, James W Buehler, Nicole Lurie"
5753,"cancers Endolysosomal Ca 2+ Signalling and Cancer Hallmarks: Two-Pore Channels on the Move, TRPML1 Lags Behind!","abstractthe acidic vesicles of the endolysosomal (el) system are emerging as an intracellular ca 2+ store implicated in the regulation of multiple cellular functions. the el ca 2+ store releases ca 2+ through a variety of ca 2+ -permeable channels, including transient receptor potential (trp) mucolipin 1-3 (trpml1-3) and two-pore channels 1-2 (tpc1-2), whereas el ca 2+ refilling is sustained by the proton gradient across the el membrane and/or by the endoplasmic reticulum (er). el ca 2+ signals may be either spatially restricted to control vesicle trafficking, autophagy and membrane repair or may be amplified into a global ca 2+ signal through the ca 2+ -dependent recruitment of er-embedded channels. emerging evidence suggested that nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (naadp)-gated tpcs sustain multiple cancer hallmarks, such as migration, invasiveness and angiogenesis. herein, we first survey the el ca 2+ refilling and release mechanisms and then focus on the oncogenic role of el ca 2+ signaling. while the evidence in favor of trpml1 involvement in neoplastic transformation is yet to be clearly provided, tpcs are emerging as an alternative target for anticancer therapies.cancers 2019, 11, 27 2 of 28 (serca), the mitochondrial ca

opening of ca 2+ -permeable channels, which are located either on the pm or on the membrane of endogenous organelles, in response to extracellular stimulation. typically, extracellular agonists, including growth factors, cytokines, neurotransmitters and hormones, bind to their specific tyrosine kinase receptors (tkrs) or g q -protein coupled receptors (gpcrs), thereby recruiting, respectively, phospholipase cγ (plcγ) and plcβ, which in turn cleave phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (pip 2 ) into inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (insp 3 ) and diacyl-glycerol (dag) . subsequently, insp 3 primes immobile insp 3 receptors (insp 3 rs), which reside at juxtaposed endoplasmic reticulum (er)-pm junctions, to respond to cytosolic ca 2+ according to the process of ca 2+ -induced ca 2+ release (cicr), which enables to spatially restricted ca 2+ signals to spread across the cytoplasm as a regenerative ca 2+ wave  6] . moreover, insp 3 -induced ca 2+ release can be further amplified by the recruitment of adjoining ryanodine receptors (ryrs), which are also sensitive to cicr  . additionally, insp 3 -induced ca 2+ release causes a large drop in the er ca 2+ concentration (ca 2+ ] er ) which triggers a signaling cascade leading to the opening of a ca 2+ -permeable pathway on the pm, known as store-operated ca 2+ entry (soce)  9] . soce is activated when er ca 2+ dissociates from the luminal ef hands domain of stim1 (stromal interaction molecule 1), the sensor of ca 2+ ] er , which undergoes a dramatic conformational change and sub-cellular repositioning. the depletion of er ca 2+ induces stim1 to oligomerize and translocate from its reticular location in the bulk er to specialized er-pm junctions (≈20 nm) where it forms stim1 puncta and interacts with the pore-forming subunit of store-operated channels (socs), orai1  . the dynamic interplay between insp 3 -induced er ca 2+ release and soce gives raise to distinct spatio-temporally complex ca 2+ signatures, ranging from local ca 2+ puffs to repetitive global ca 2+ oscillations, that selectively regulate different cellular functions  10, 11] .the er is by far the largest and best studied intracellular ca 2+ reservoir engaged by extracellular stimuli, possessing a complete repertoire of ca 2+ pumps, i.e., serca, to effect filling, luminal ca 2+ -binding proteins, e.g., calnexin and calreticulin, to effect buffering and ca 2+ -permeable channels, i.e., insp 3 rs and ryrs, to effect release  12] . nevertheless, the er is not the sole endogenous ca 2+ store in mammalian cells. it has been shown that also the acidic vesicles of the endo-lysosomal (el) system serve as an additional ca 2+ reservoir that is recruited by extracellular ligands through the generation of the novel ca 2+ -releasing second messenger, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (naadp)     . the battery of ca 2+ refilling and release mechanisms endowed to acidic el vesicles is emerging as a crucial signalling network to finely tune local processes, such as membrane fusion and individualized vesicular movements  . in addition, the establishment of el-er membrane contact sites (mcss) enables el ca 2+ release to trigger cytosolic ca 2+ waves by recruiting er-resident insp 3 rs and ryrs through the cicr process  18] .herein, we discuss the emerging role of el ca 2+ signalling in tumorigenesis    . we first illustrate the basic mechanisms of el ca 2+ refilling and release by focusing on the wealth of ca 2+ -permeable channels that effect el ca 2+ mobilization, i.e., transient receptor potential (trp) mucolipin 1-3 (trpml1-3), two-pore channels 1-2 (tpc1-2), trp melastatin 2 (trpm2), trp ankyrin 1 (trpa1), p2x4 receptors and voltage-gated ca 2+ channels ( figure 1 ). then, we describe how tpcs control several cancer hallmarks, including migration, invasiveness and angiogenesis, and the potential tumorigenic function of trpml1. finally, we speculate about the possibility to interfere with the el ca 2+ signalling machinery to design alternative anticancer treatments, by focusing on tpcs as emerging molecular targets.","Pawan Faris, Mudhir Shekha, Daniela Montagna,

10314,"Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroimmunology, a section of the journal Frontiers in Immunology Central Nervous System Inflammatory Aggregates in the Theiler's Virus Model of Progressive Multiple Sclerosis","abstractor inflammatory demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (ms), results in the accumulation of various b cell subsets in the cns, including naïve, activated, memory b cells (bmem), and antibody secreting cells (asc). however, factors driving heterogeneous b cell subset accumulation and antibody (ab) production in the cns compartment, including the contribution of ectopic lymphoid follicles (elf), during chronic cns inflammation remain unclear and is a major gap in our understanding of neuroinflammation. we sought to address this gap using the theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease (tmev-idd) model of progressive ms. in this model, injection of the virus into susceptible mouse strains results in a persistent infection associated with demyelination and progressive disability. during chronic infection, the predominant b cell phenotypes accumulating in the cns were isotype-switched b cells, including bmem and asc with naïve/early activated and transitional b cells present at low frequencies. b cell accumulation in the cns during chronic tmev-idd coincided with intrathecal ab synthesis in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf). mature and isotype-switched b cells predominately localized to the meninges and perivascular space, with igg isotype-switched b cells frequently accumulating in the parenchymal space. both mature and isotype-switched b cells and t cells occupied meningeal and perivascular spaces, with minimal evidence for spatial organization typical of elf mimicking secondary lymphoid organs (slo). moreover, immunohistological analysis of immune cell aggregates revealed a lack of slo-like elf features, such as cell proliferation, cell death, and germinal center b cell markers. nonetheless, flow cytometric assessment of b cells within the cns showed enhanced expression of activation markers, including moderate upregulation of gl7 and expression of the costimulatory molecule cd80. b cell-related chemokines and trophic factors, including april, baff, cxcl9, cxcl10, ccl19, and cxcl13, were elevated in the cns. these results indicate that localization of heterogeneous b cell populations, including activated and isotype-switched b cell phenotypes, to the cns and intrathecal ab (itab) synthesis can occur independently of slo-like follicles during chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease.","Jorge Ivan Alvarez, Steven M Kerfoot, Jen Gommerman, Krista D Disano, Darlene B Royce, Francesca Gilli, Andrew R Pachner"
12395,Improvement in Clinical Symptoms and Fecal Microbiome After Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in a Dog with Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"abstractpurpose: recently, fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) has been tested in veterinary medicine as a treatment option for multiple gastrointestinal (gi) diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). however, there are no reports of changes in the microbial diversity of fecal microbiome after treatment with fmt in canine ibd cases. moreover, little is known about the long-term efficacy and safety of fmt treatment for dogs. herein, we present a case of canine intractable ibd treated with repeated, long-term fmt. patients and methods: the patient was a 10-year-old, neutered, male, 4-kg toy poodle with a prolonged history of vomiting and diarrhea. fecal examination for pathogens was negative. despite treatment with multiple antibacterial and antidiarrheal agents, the patient showed no improvement. endoscopic mucus sampling diagnosed a case of lymphocyticplasmacytic duodenitis, ie, idiopathic ibd. eventually, we performed periodic, long-term fecal microbiota transplantation of fresh donor feces collected from a 4-year-old, 32.8-kg, neutered male golden retriever by rectal enema. additionally, we performed 16s rrna sequence analysis, before and after fmt, to evaluate the microbiome diversity. results: fecal microbiome diversity after fmt resembled that of the healthy donor dog's fecal microbiome, before fmt, which led us to conclude that the fecal microbiome in our patient normalized with fmt. moreover, the clinical symptoms improved remarkably with regard to the changes in the fecal microbiome. additionally, we noted no observable side effects during fmt treatment. conclusion: this report indicates the efficacy and safety of long-term, periodic fmt for a case of canine ibd based on attenuation of clinical symptoms and changes in fecal microbiome diversity. therefore, fmt could be chosen as a treatment option for ibd in canines in the future.","Ayaka Niina, Ryoko Kibe, Ryohei Suzuki, Yunosuke Yuchi, Takahiro Teshima, Hirotaka Matsumoto, Yasushi Kataoka, Hidekazu Koyama"
9109,The efficacy of medical masks and respirators against respiratory infection in healthcare workers,"abstractwe aimed to examine the efficacy of medical masks and respirators in protecting against respiratory infections using pooled data from two homogenous randomised control clinical trials (rcts).the data collected on 3591 subjects in two similar rcts conducted in beijing, china, which examined the same infection outcomes, were pooled. four interventions were compared: (i) continuous n95 respirator use, (ii) targeted n95 respirator use, (iii) medical mask use and (iv) control arm. the outcomes were laboratoryconfirmed viral respiratory infection, influenza a or b, laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonisation and pathogens grouped by mode of transmission.rates of all outcomes were consistently lower in the continuous n95 and/or targeted n95 arms. in adjusted analysis, rates of laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonisation (rr 0.33, 95% ci 0.21-0.51), laboratory-confirmed viral infections (rr 0.46, 95% ci 0.23-0.91) and droplet-transmitted infections (rr 0.26, 95% ci 0.16-0.42) were significantly lower in the continuous n95 arm. laboratory-confirmed influenza was also lowest in the continuous n95 arm (rr 0.34, 95% ci 0.10-1.11), but the difference was not statistically significant. rates of laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonisation (rr 0.54, 95% ci 0.33-0.87) and droplet-transmitted infections (rr 0.43, 95% ci 0.25-0.72) were also lower in the targeted n95 arm, but not in medical mask arm.the results suggest that the classification of infections into droplet versus airborne transmission is an oversimplification. most guidelines recommend masks for infections spread by droplets. n95 respirators, as ""airborne precautions,"" provide superior protection for droplet-transmitted infections. to ensure the occupational health and safety of healthcare worker, the superiority of respirators in preventing respiratory infections should be reflected in infection control guidelines.droplet infections, healthcare workers, influenza, masks, medical masks, respirators","Raina Chandini,  Macintyre, | Abrar, Ahmad Chughtai, | Bayzidur Rahman, Yang Peng, | Yi Zhang, | Holly Seale, | Xiaoli Wang, Quanyi Wang"
6995,cells Regulation of Ribosomal Proteins on Viral Infection,"abstractribosomal proteins (rps), in conjunction with rrna, are major components of ribosomes involved in the cellular process of protein biosynthesis, known as ""translation"". the viruses, as the small infectious pathogens with limited genomes, must recruit a variety of host factors to survive and propagate, including rps. at present, more and more information is available on the functional relationship between rps and virus infection. this review focuses on advancements in my own understanding of critical roles of rps in the life cycle of viruses. various rps interact with viral mrna and proteins to participate in viral protein biosynthesis and regulate the replication and infection of virus in host cells. most interactions are essential for viral translation and replication, which promote viral infection and accumulation, whereas the minority represents the defense signaling of host cells by activating immune pathway against virus. rps provide a new platform for antiviral therapy development, however, at present, antiviral therapeutics with rps involving in virus infection as targets is limited, and exploring antiviral strategy based on rps will be the guides for further study.the predominant translation initiation pathway of cellular mrna is cap-dependent, which requires recognition of mrna 5 cap by the eukaryotic initiation factor 4e (eif4e). eif4e interacts with eif4g and eif4a to form the cap binding complex (eif4f), recruiting the 40s subunit to the 5 end of mrna ( figure 1a) . however, many viral mrnas have no 5 cap structures. the cap-snatching from host mrna is an effective strategy  13] , while some rna viruses utilize a cap-independent manner to recruit the ribosome, which is mediated by the internal ribosome entry site (ires)    .ires is a cis-element in 5 untranslated region (utr) of viral mrna, and it can recruit ribosomes to initiate the synthesis of viral proteins  18] . according to the secondary structure, required initiation factors (eifs) and location of the start codon relative to ires, viral iress are functionally divided into four groups (ires 1-4)  . ires-1, from the intergenic region (igr) of dicistroviridae family that infects invertebrate, is the most streamlined ires, because it recruits the 40s and 60s subunits to form functional 80s complexes in the absence of any eifs    . cricket paralysis virus (crpv), plautia stali intestine virus (psiv) and taura syndrome virus (tsv) are typical members in this group  . ires-2 needs a subset of the canonical eifs (eif3, eif2) and met-trna to bind to 40s subunit  . this group is mainly from flaviviridae family that infects mammal, with hepatitis c virus (hcv) and classical swine fever virus (csfv) as typical members  22, 23] . for ires-3 (including encephalomyocarditis virus and foot-and-mouth disease virus, etc.) and ires-4 (including poliovirus and rhinovirus, etc.), besides some canonical eifs and met-trna, additional proteins named ires trans-activating factors (itafs) are also required to bind ribosome  15, 19, 24] . however, even in the simplest system, an intricate reaction network regulates translation initiation, in which rps are essential  25] .although ires-1 and ires-2 both induce a conformational change in the ribosome upon binding  26, 27] , their binding sites to 40s subunit are different. ires-1 binds to the intersubunit surface of 40s subunit occupying the peptidyl (p) and exit (e) sites  , and ires-2 binds to the solvent side of 40s subunit and occupies e site  . the binding to 40s subunit of ires-2 is regulated by rps5 with its β-hairpin structure, independently of rps25 (a rps5 neighbor situated in the head domain of 40s subunit) ( figure 1d )      . whereas ires-1 depends on rps25 for binding to 40s subunit ( figure 1c )  31, 34] , in which rps5 could maintain the accuracy of translation in eukaryotes  . rps25 is non-essential in viral cap-dependent translation, but it plays a critical role in all viral ires-mediated translation. the propagation of hcv and poliovirus is impaired in cells depleted of rps25 . this is because, after 40s subunit recruitment, all groups of iress rely on rps25 for efficient translation ( figure 1c ,d)  34, 36] . rps25 likely functions in a downstream step, such as loading of viral mrna into 40s subunit, start codon recognition, or 60s subunit joining  36] . when cap-dependent translation initiation is hindered, the 5 leader of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) genomic rna can fold into ires to recruit 40s subunit and drive translation initiation of viral gag protein, in which the activity of ires is also dependent on rps25  . rack1, as ribosome scaffold protein, is also required for viral ires-2-mediated translation, and the effect of rack1 may associate with eif3 to assemble a translation preinitiation complex  . in addition, it is demonstrated that the intracellular level of 40s subunit plays a key role in facilitating hcv translation over host translation, and the translation initiation of hcv ires and host mrna possess different susceptibility for reduction of 40s subunit  . rps2 (p40), rps3a, rps14 and rps16 can interact with hcv",Shuo Li

6778,micromachines Recent Advances in AIV Biosensors Composed of Nanobio Hybrid Material,"abstractsince the beginning of the 2000s, globalization has accelerated because of the development of transportation systems that allow for human and material exchanges throughout the world. however, this globalization has brought with it the rise of various pathogenic viral agents, such as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), zika virus, and dengue virus. in particular, avian influenza virus (aiv) is highly infectious and causes economic, health, ethnical, and social problems to human beings, which has necessitated the development of an ultrasensitive and selective rapid-detection system of aiv. to prevent the damage associated with the spread of aiv, early detection and adequate treatment of aiv is key. there are traditional techniques that have been used to detect aiv in chickens, ducks, humans, and other living organisms. however, the development of a technique that allows for the more rapid diagnosis of aiv is still necessary. to achieve this goal, the present article reviews the use of an aiv biosensor employing nanobio hybrid materials to enhance the sensitivity and selectivity of the technique while also reducing the detection time and high-throughput process time. this review mainly focused on four techniques: the electrochemical detection system, electrical detection method, optical detection methods based on localized surface plasmon resonance, and fluorescence.","Taek Lee, Jae-Hyuk Ahn, Sun Yong Park, Ga-Hyeon Kim, Jeonghyun Kim, Tae-Hyung Kim, Inho Nam, Chulhwan Park, Min-Ho Lee"
10035,molecules Novel Antiretroviral Structures from Marine Organisms,"abstractin spite of significant advancements and success in antiretroviral therapies directed against hiv infection, there is no cure for hiv, which scan persist in a human body in its latent form and become reactivated under favorable conditions. therefore, novel antiretroviral drugs with different modes of actions are still a major focus for researchers. in particular, novel lead structures are being sought from natural sources. so far, a number of compounds from marine organisms have been identified as promising therapeutics for hiv infection. therefore, in this paper, we provide an overview of marine natural products that were first identified in the period between 2013 and 2018 that could be potentially used, or further optimized, as novel antiretroviral agents. this pipeline includes the systematization of antiretroviral activities for several categories of marine structures including chitosan and its derivatives, sulfated polysaccharides, lectins, bromotyrosine derivatives, peptides, alkaloids, diterpenes, phlorotannins, and xanthones as well as adjuvants to the haart therapy such as fish oil. we critically discuss the structures and activities of the most promising new marine anti-hiv compounds.","Karlo Wittine, Lara Saftić, Željka Peršurić, Sandra Kraljević Pavelić"
5130,Profiling of cellular proteins in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus virions by proteomics analysis,"abstractbackground: porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) is an enveloped virus, bearing severe economic consequences to the swine industry worldwide. previous studies on enveloped viruses have shown that many incorporated cellular proteins associated with the virion's membranes that might play important roles in viral infectivity. in this study, we sought to proteomically profile the cellular proteins incorporated into or associated with the virions of a highly virulent prrsv strain gdby1, and to provide foundation for further investigations on the roles of incorporated/associated cellular proteins on prrsv's infectivity. results: in our experiment, sixty one cellular proteins were identified in highly purified prrsv virions by twodimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometric approaches. the identified cellular proteins could be grouped into eight functional categories including cytoskeletal proteins, chaperones, macromolecular biosynthesis proteins, metabolism-associated proteins, calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins and other functional proteins. among the identified proteins, four have not yet been reported in other studied envelope viruses, namely, guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase, peroxiredoxin 1 and galectin-1 protein. the presence of five selected cellular proteins (i.e., β-actin, tubulin, annexin a2, heat shock protein hsp27, and calcium binding proteins s100) in the highly purified prrsv virions was validated by western blot and immunogold labeling assays.conclusions: taken together, the present study has demonstrated the incorporation of cellular proteins in prrsv virions, which provides valuable information for the further investigations for the effects of individual cellular proteins on the viral replication, assembly, and pathogenesis.","Chengwen Zhang, Chunyi Xue, Yan Li, Qingming Kong, Xiangpeng Ren, Xiaoming Li, Dingming Shu, Yingzuo Bi, Yongchang Cao"
8462,Debate around infection-dependent hemophagocytic syndrome in paediatrics,"abstractbackground: hemophagocytic syndrome (hps) is clinically defined as a combination of fever, liver dysfunction, coagulation abnormalities, pancytopenia, progressive macrophage proliferation throughout the reticuloendothelial system, and cytokine over-production, and may be primary or secondary to infectious, auto-immune, and tumoral diseases. the most consistent association is with viral infections but, as it is still debated whether any micro-organisms are involved in its pathogenesis, we critically appraised the literature concerning hps and its relationship with infections.discussion: infection-dependent hps has been widely observed, but there are no data concerning its incidence in children. a better understanding of the pathophysiology of hps may clarify the interactions between the immune system and the variously implicated potential infectious agents. epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection has been prominently associated with hps, with clonal proliferation and the hyperactivation of ebv-infected t cells. however, a number of other viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections have been reported in association with hps. in the case of low-risk hps, corticosteroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulin or cyclosporine a may be sufficient to control the biological process, but etoposide is recommended as a means of reversing infection-dependent lymphohistiocytic dysregulation in high-risk cases.","Valentina Ansuini, Donato Rigante, Susanna Esposito"
8653,Analysis of Intraviral Protein-Protein Interactions of the SARS Coronavirus ORFeome,"abstractthe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) genome is predicted to encode 14 functional open reading frames, leading to the expression of up to 30 structural and non-structural protein products. the functions of a large number of viral orfs are poorly understood or unknown. in order to gain more insight into functions and modes of action and interaction of the different proteins, we cloned the viral orfeome and performed a genome-wide analysis for intraviral protein interactions and for intracellular localization. 900 pairwise interactions were tested by yeast-two-hybrid matrix analysis, and more than 65 positive non-redundant interactions, including six self interactions, were identified. about 38% of interactions were subsequently confirmed by coip in mammalian cells. nsp2, nsp8 and orf9b showed a wide range of interactions with other viral proteins. nsp8 interacts with replicase proteins nsp2, nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14, indicating a crucial role as a major player within the replication complex machinery. it was shown by others that nsp8 is essential for viral replication in vitro, whereas nsp2 is not. we show that also accessory protein orf9b does not play a pivotal role for viral replication, as it can be deleted from the virus displaying normal plaque sizes and growth characteristics in vero cells. however, it can be expected to be important for the virus-host interplay and for pathogenicity, due to its large number of interactions, by enhancing the global stability of the sars proteome network, or play some unrealized role in regulating protein-protein interactions. the interactions identified provide valuable material for future studies. citation: von brunn a, teepe c, simpson jc, pepperkok r, friedel cc, et al (2007) analysis of intraviral protein-protein interactions of the sars coronavirus orfeome. plos one 2(5): e459.","Albrecht Von Brunn, Carola Teepe, Jeremy C Simpson, Rainer Pepperkok, Caroline C Friedel, Ralf Zimmer, Rhonda Roberts, Ralph Baric, Jü Rgen Haas"
9915,Identification of Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibodies Targeting Novel Conformational Epitopes of the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea Virus Spike Protein,"abstract, by the generation of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nmabs). two nmabs, p4b-1, and e10e-1-10 that recognized the ectodomain of the full-length recombinant pedv s protein and exhibited neutralizing ability against the pedv-pt virus were selected. recombinant truncated s proteins were used to identify the target sequences for the nmabs and p4b-1 was shown to recognize the c-terminus of co-26k equivalent epitope (coe) at amino acids (a.a.) 575-639 of the pedv s. interestingly, e10e-1-10 could recognize a novel neutralizing epitope at a.a. 435-485 within the s1 a domain of the pedv s protein, whose importance and function are yet to be determined. moreover, both nmabs could not bind to linearized s proteins, indicating that only conformational epitopes are recognized. this data could improve our understanding of the antigenic structures of the pedv s protein and facilitate future development of novel epitope-based vaccines.porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (pedv) causes porcine epidemic diarrhoea (ped), a highly contagious disease characterized by acute watery diarrhoea, vomiting, and dehydration, and with a high mortality rate particularly in suckling piglets 1,2 . the first outbreak of ped was recorded in the european and asian swine industries in the early 1970s and then spread to many countries 3,4 . in 2010, novel and highly virulent pedv strains were identified in china, which later spread to several countries 1,5,6 . these new variants of pedv have caused high morbidity and mortality in neonatal piglets, resulting in serious economic loss to the swine industry 1,7 . thus, there is an urgent need for in-depth and comprehensive studies on the antigenicity and immunogenicity of pedvs in order to facilitate disease control and eradication.pedv is a single-stranded rna virus, approximately 28 kb in size, which belongs to the genus alphacoronavirus 8 . the pedv genome comprises of seven open reading frames (orfs) that encode for non-structural proteins responsible for viral genome replication and transcription, as well as four structural proteins, namely spike (s), envelope (e), membrane (m), and nucleocapsid (n) proteins 8,9 . among the structural proteins, the s glycoprotein plays a critical role in host affinity, virus-cell recognition, membrane fusion and entry 1,10,11 . moreover, it contains multiple neutralizing epitopes that make it a suitable target for vaccines designed to neutralize pedvs 12-14 .several neutralizing epitopes have been identified on the s protein of the pedvs such as the co-26k equivalent epitope (coe epitope) 12 , the antigen epitope motif recognized by the monoclonal antibody (mab) 2c10 at the c-terminal end of the s protein 13 , and a neutralizing epitope named s1d 14,15 . recently, five core cell attachment domains of the pedv s1 protein, s1 0 , s1 a , s1 b , s1 c , and s1 d , were proposed based on the three-dimensional structures cryo-em of alphacoronaviruses 16,17 . the proposed s1 0 domain has a sialic acid binding domain 10 . the s1 b domain is a common location for receptor binding in coronaviruses and can be a potential neutralizing target for the new pedv variant capable of eliciting the production of cross-neutralizing antibodies against different pedv strains 17 . furthermore, several linear b-cell epitopes of pedv overlapping with s1d have been shown to neutralize both the historic strain as well as the new variant pedv strains 18 . till date, no neutralizing epitope has been identified in the s1 a domain of the historic or the new pedv variant strains.to understand the antigenicity of pedv, we generated a panel of neutralizing mabs (nmabs) by immunizing balb/c mice with inactivated pedv viral particles. the neutralizing epitopes of the pedv-pt s protein, recognized by two of the nmabs, were characterized using a series of c-terminal truncated recombinant pedv-pt s proteins under native and denaturing conditions. this approach allows us to identify conformational epitopes of pedv-pt strain and helps in understanding the antigenicity and pathogenesis of the g2b pedv.generation and purification of anti-pedv spike mabs. to map the epitopes of the new variants of pedv, the hybridomas originating from pedv-immunized mice were generated that secreted mabs into the culture supernatant. these mabs were collected from the supernatant and were used for immunocytochemical (icc) staining with the full-length pedv spike-expressing human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells. three mabs, p4b-1, e10e-1-10, and r7h-2, which had a binding titre greater than 1:160 for pedv spike-expressing hek293 cells, were selected and purified. one mab, unk-1, which had no binding affinity for the pedv spike-expressing hek293 cells, was also selected to be a negative control for the subsequent assays. after purification of the mabs along with the protein l, which targets the fc region of the mice-originated antibodies, the pure mabs of p4b-1, e10e-1-10, r7h-2, and unk-1 were obtained at 400 μg/ml, 250 μg/ml, 900 μg/ml, and 400 μg/ml, respectively.scientific reports | (2019) 9:2529 |    for 1 h. then, the mab-virus mixtures were transferred to the vero cell monolayer in

plates were incubated at 37 °c for 48 h and cytopathic effects (cpe) were monitored every 24 h. pedv spike-specific mab selection and epitope mapping by icc staining. to select pedv spike-specific mabs and for epitope mapping of these nmabs, icc staining of mabs to full-length pedv s and truncated s protein-expressing hek293 cells were performed. hek293 cells expressing truncated pedv spike proteins were seeded onto 96-well culture plates at 80% confluency and fixed using 80% acetone. after air-drying and washing thrice with 200 μl pbs/well, wells were incubated with 200 μl of each

2305,ABSTRACTS C01 Pharmacodynamics of Entresto® (Sacubitril/Valsartan) Versus Placebo in Dogs with Preclinical Myxomatous Mitral Valve Disease C02 Trimethylamine-N-Oxide and its Precursors in Dogs with Degenerative Mitral Valve Disease Comparison Between the Effects of Torsemide and Furosemide on the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System of Normal Dogs C04 Transvenous Echocardiography in Conscious Sedated Horses C06 Complications and Outcomes of Multi-Institution Transvenous Pacemaker Implantation,"abstractangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (acei) are standard of care for treatment of congestive heart failure, but aldosterone breakthrough occurs when acei are used in both dogs and humans. entresto®, a combinational angiotensin-receptor blocker/neprilysin inhibitor, showed superiority in reducing mortality in human patients with heart failure compared to enalapril. pharmacodynamics of entresto® have been evaluated in healthy dogs, showing efficacy in altering the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas) without causing adverse effects. the aim of this prospective, blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study was to compare the pharmacodynamic effects of entresto® to placebo in dogs with preclinical myxomatous mitral valve disease (mmvd) and to evaluate the safety profile of entresto® in dogs with cardiac disease. client-owned dogs weighing 4-15 kg with acvim stage b2 mmvd were enrolled. dogs with clinically significant pulmonary hypertension or systemic disease were excluded, as were dogs on any medication(s) known to alter the raas. all dogs received pimobendan throughout the study period. each patient was evaluated at three time points (day 0, day 7, and day 30). echocardiography, thoracic radiographs (cxr), doppler systemic arterial pressure (sap), complete blood count, serum biochemical profile, plasma n-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (nt-probnp) concentration, and urinary aldosterone to creatinine ratio (ualdo:c) were evaluated on day 0. on day 0, each dog was randomly allocated to a treatment group (entresto®; 20 mg/kg bid) or a placebo group by the attending pharmacist. investigators, veterinary technicians, and owners were blinded to treatment. serum renal enzyme and electrolyte concentrations and sap were rechecked on day 7. echocardiography, cxr, sap, renal panel, plasma nt-probnp concentration, and ualdo:c were rechecked on day 30. thirteen dogs were recruited: entresto® (n = 7) and placebo (n = 6). the median percent increase in ualdo:c between day 0 and day 30 was significantly lower in the entresto® group (12%; p = 0.032) as compared to the placebo group (195%). the median percent decrease of nt-probnp concentration from day 0 to day 30 was not statistically different between groups (p = 0.68). no statistical differences were seen in echocardiographic, cxr, sap, or biochemical profiles measured at any time point between groups. no adverse events were noted by the owners for dogs in either group. this study suggests that entresto® efficiently inhibits raas in dogs with cardiomegaly secondary to mmvd in comparison to placebo. entresto® is safe in regards to sap and renal enzyme and electrolyte concentrations. no adverse effects were noted in any dog taking entresto®. future studies comparing entresto® to acei, evaluating the concomitant use of diuretics and entresto®, and evaluating longterm (> 30 days) effects of entresto® are warranted. trimethylamine n-oxide (tmao), the oxidized product of trimethylamine, is produced by gastrointestinal microbiota from certain dietary nutrients including choline and l-carnitine. elevated plasma concentrations of tmao, choline, and l-carnitine have been shown to be associated with the presence and severity of cardiovascular disease in people and are independent predictors of adverse cardiac events and mortality. this prospective study investigated whether there are differences in concentrations of circulating tmao, choline, or l-carnitine in dogs with degenerative mitral valve disease (dmvd) compared to healthy controls (controls).thirty client-owned dogs were recruited, including 10 dogs with chf secondary to dmvd, 10 dogs with asymptomatic dmvd, and 10 controls. echocardiography was performed, and fasting plasma concentrations of tmao, choline, and carnitine fractions were measured. data were compared among the three groups using anova or kruskal-wallis tests.trimethylamine n-oxide (p = 0.034), total l-carnitine (p = 0.034), carnitine esters, and carnitine esters to free carnitine ratio (e/f ratio) were significantly higher in dogs with chf compared to asymptomatic dmvd. trimethylamine n-oxide (p = 0.022), choline (p = 0.011), total l-carnitine (p = 0.011), carnitine esters, free carnitine, and e/f ratio were significantly higher in dogs with chf compared to controls. no differences were detected between asymptomatic dmvd dogs and controls.dogs with dmvd and chf had higher concentrations of tmao compared to both asymptomatic dmvd dogs and controls. prospective studies are warranted to determine if tmao concentrations can be altered with dietary or gut microflora modification, and whether altering tmao concentrations could impact disease progression.loop diuretics provide symptomatic relief for congestive heart failure, yet stimulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas). we hypothesized that the two potent loop diuretics, torsemide and furosemide, at approximately equipotent dosages (similar diuresis), would have comparable effects on the circulating raas.six, healthy, middle-aged, male beagles were randomized to receive torsemide (0.1mg/kg po q12h), furosemide (2.0mg/kg po q12h), or placebo for 10 days during 3 separate experiments, in a crossover design with a 10-day washout period between experiments. blood was collected on days 1, 5, and 9 and 24-hour urine collection ended on days 2, 6, and 10. after repeated measures analysis and bonferonni correction, variables with an adjusted p < 0.05 were investigated further, using tukey';s method.twenty-four hour urine production differed significantly between the diuretics only on day 10, with torsemide causing a 38% greater diuresis than furosemide. there was, however, no significant difference in average 3-day diuresis. there were no significant differences between diuretics in the 24-hour urinary excretion of na + , cl -, or k + , though furosemide caused less kaliuresis than torsemide. serum renin, angiotensin ii, and aldosterone and the urine aldosterone-to-creatinine ratio were significantly increased in the diuretic groups, as compared to placebo on days 5/6 and 9/10. there were no significant differences in these parameters between diuretics. creatinine and bun concentrations rose comparably in the 2 diuretic groups, remaining within reference intervals in all dogs.at approximately equipotent dosages (20:1), torsemide and furosemide produced comparable raas activation. this, and torsemide';s greater kaliuretic effect decrease support for torsemide';s hypothesized mineralocorticoid-receptor blocking capability.transvenous pacemaker implantation is the definitive treatment for pathologic bradyarrhythmias, though reported complication rates have historically been high. the purpose of this study was to determine survival times and complication rates for dogs who underwent transve-atenolol is a β 1 -receptor antagonist commonly prescribed in cats affected with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. the traditional oral dose is 6.25 to 12.5 mg per cat q12-24h. the oral tablet is highly bioavailable (90 ± 9%) with peak atenolol concentration occurring 1-2 hours post administration in cats. however results from several studies indicate owner compliance may be poor with long-term oral treatment, and feline disposition can present specific challenges to owners with chronic oral medication administration. previous","Daniel K Newhard,

10953,Current Research on Non-Coding Ribonucleic Acid (RNA),"abstractnon-coding ribonucleic acid (rna) has without a doubt captured the interest of biomedical researchers. the ability to screen the entire human genome with high-throughput sequencing technology has greatly enhanced the identification, annotation and prediction of the functionality of non-coding rnas. in this review, we discuss the current landscape of non-coding rna research and quantitative analysis. non-coding rna will be categorized into two major groups by size: long non-coding rnas and small rnas. in long non-coding rna, we discuss regular long non-coding rna, pseudogenes and circular rna. in small rna, we discuss mirna, transfer rna, piwi-interacting rna, small nucleolar rna, small nuclear rna, y rna, single recognition particle rna, and 7sk rna. we elaborate on the origin, detection method, and potential association with disease, putative functional mechanisms, and public resources for these non-coding rnas. we aim to provide readers with a complete overview of non-coding rnas and incite additional interest in non-coding rna research.","Jing Wang, David C Samuels, Shilin Zhao, Yu Xiang, Ying-Yong Zhao, Yan Guo"
8529,Hydrogen sulfide ameliorates chronic renal failure in rats by inhibiting apoptosis and inflammation through ROS/MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways OPEN,"abstractchronic renal failure (crf) is a major public health problem worldwide. hydrogen sulfide (h 2 s) plays important roles in renal physiological and pathophysiological processes. however, whether h 2 s could protect against crf in rats remains unclear. in this study, we found that h 2 s alleviated gentamicininduced nephrotoxicity by reducing reactive oxygen species (ros)-mediated apoptosis in normal rat kidney-52e cells. we demonstrated that h 2 s significantly improved the kidney structure and function of crf rats. we found that h 2 s decreased the protein levels of bax, caspase-3, and cleaved-caspase-3, but increased the expression of bcl-2. treatment with h 2 s reduced the levels of malondialdehyde and ros and increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. h 2 s significantly abolished the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2, c-jun n-terminal kinase, and p38 in the kidney of crf rats. furthermore, h 2 s decreased the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (il)-6, il-10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, as well as the protein levels of p50, p65, and p-p65 in the kidney of crf rats. in conclusion, h 2 s could ameliorate adenine-induced crf in rats by inhibiting apoptosis and inflammation through ros/mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappa b signaling pathways.as the incidence of chronic renal failure (crf) increases at an alarming rate, crf has been considered a major public health problem worldwide 1 . crf is a syndrome characterized by progressive and irreversible deterioration of renal function 2 . in humans, crf is mainly caused by hypertension, glomerulonephritis, and diabetes mellitus 3, 4 . this condition is made worse by a deterioration in nutrition level caused by accumulation of uremic toxins and reduced food intake, which could be attributed to many factors, such as gastrointestinal congestion, loss of appetite, and reduced glomerular filtration rate 4-6 . compared to patients with other chronic diseases, patients with crf tend to require longer and more frequent hospitalizations which are associated with higher morbidity and mortality 7 . therefore, it is urgent to develop alternative medicines and novel therapies for the treatment of crf.hydrogen sulfide (h 2 s) has recently been identified as the third endogenous gaseous transmitter that is enzymatically synthesized by cystathionine γ-lyase (cse), cystathionine β-synthase (cbs), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-mst) in mammalian tissues 8, 9 . these enzymes have been identified in the kidney and are responsible for endogenous renal h 2 s production 10-12 . an increasing number of studies indicate that h 2 s plays an important role in renal physiology and pathology 11, 13, 14 . the physiological level of h 2 s leads to vasodilation and increases glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow, which causes an indirect increase of the urinary excretion of k + and na + 13 . under pathological conditions, h 2 s exerts the protective role in a number of experimental models of renal disease, including obstructive nephropathy 11 , renal ischemia-reperfusion injury 15 , and published: xx xx xxxx open  2 scientific reports | 7: 455 | diabetic nephropathy 16 . recent studies demonstrated that h 2 s is significantly lower in plasma and tissues of uremic patients and 5/6 nephrectomy rats    . considering the beneficial effects of h 2 s in renal physiology and pathology, we hypothesize that the application of exogenous h 2 s may effectively protect against crf.gentamicin (gen), an aminoglycoside antibiotic, plays an important role in the treatment of a wide range of gram-negative bacterial infections. however, nephrotoxicity is considered as its major side effect, which seriously limits its clinical use 20, 21 . gen has been widely used in in vitro models through inducing nephrotoxicity, such as normal rat kidney (nrk)-52e cells    . in this study, we investigated the effects of h 2 s on the nephrotoxicity induced by gen in nrk-52e cells. the adenine-induced crf model in rats is a standard method for inducing metabolic abnormalities closely resembling those observed in uremic patients 23, 24 . therefore, a rat model of adenine-induced crf was used in the present study. we also investigated the effects and mechanisms of h 2 s on adenine-induced crf in rats.cell culture. nrk-52e cells were obtained from icell bioscience inc. (shanghai, china) and maintained in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (dmem)/f12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 100 u/ml penicillin. cells were cultured in a humidified incubator with 5% co 2 and 95% air at 37 °c. confluent nrk-52e cells were transferred to serum-free dmem/f12 medium for overnight starvation before each experiment. nrk-52e cells were incubated with 3 mm gen for 24 h to induce nephrotoxicity 25 . the cells were divided into three groups: control group, gen group, and gen+h 2 s group. the control and gen groups were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and the gen+h 2 s group was treated with 100 µm nahs (an h 2 s donor, dissolved in pbs). treatments with pbs and nahs were concomitant to gen-induced nephrotoxicity for 24 h.for 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (edu) incorporation assay, the proliferating cells were examined using the cell-light edu apollo 567 in vitro imaging kit (ribobio, guangzhou, guangdong, china). briefly, after incubation with 10 mm edu for 2 h, nrk-52e cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.3% triton x-100 and stained with the fluorescent dyes. 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi) (5 mg/ml) was used to stain the cell nuclei for 10 min at room temperature. then the cells were visualized under a fluorescent microscope (eclipse ti, nikon, melville, ny, usa) from five random fields. cell proliferation rate = (edu-positive cells)/(total number of cells) × 100%. cell growth was also measured using the celltiter 96 aq ueous one solution cell proliferation assay kit (mts; promega, madison, wi, usa) according to the manufacturer's protocols.ured by using a 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (dcf-da)-cellular reactive oxygen species detection assay kit (beyotime institute of biotechnology, shanghai, china). cells were incubated with 10 μm dcf-da for 30 min at 37 °c and washed three times with pbs. the fluorescence was observed by a fluorescent microscope (eclipse ti, nikon, melville, ny, usa) from five random fields and measured by imagej software (national institutes of health, bethesda, md, usa). cellular apoptosis analysis. cellular apoptosis was analyzed by performing a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dutp nick end labeling (tunel) assay using an in situ cell death detection kit (beyotime institute of biotechnology, shanghai, china) following the manufacturer's instructions. after 4% paraformaldehyde fixation and 0.1% triton x-100 permeabilization, cells were incubated with 50 μl tunel reaction mixture for 60 min at 37 °c in the dark and then rinsed with pbs three times. then after a 10 min dapi (5 mg/ml) counterstain at room temperature, cells were photographed with a fluorescent microscope (eclipse ti, nikon, melville, ny, usa) from five random fields. the apoptotic index = (positively stained apoptotic cells)/(total number of cells) × 100%.","Dongdong Wu, Ning Luo, Lianqu Wang, Zhijun Zhao, Hongmin Bu, Guoliang Xu, Yongjun Yan, Xinping Che, Zhiling Jiao, Tengfu Zhao, Jingtao Chen, Ailing Ji, Yanzhang Li, Garrick D Lee"
4767,Association between genetic polymorphisms of MMP8 and the risk of steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head in the population of northern China,"abstractbackground: steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (onfh) is the most common clinical nontraumatic onfh. once onfh occurs, it seriously reduces patients' quality of life. the matrix metalloproteinase/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (mmp/ timp) system was found to play a significant role in the development of onfh. the aim of this study was to identify the associations between 7 genes selected from the mmp/timp system and steroid-induced onfh.methods: we genotyped 34 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) of 7 genes selected from the mmp/timp system in a case-control study with 285 cases of steroid-induced onfh and 308 healthy controls. odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) were estimated using the chi-squared test, genetic model analysis, haplotype analysis, and stratification analysis.results: we found that the minor alleles of rs1940475 and rs11225395 in mmp8 were associated with a 1.32-fold increased risk of steroid-induced onfh in the allelic model analysis (p = 0.021 and 0.022, respectively). in the genetic model analysis, we found that rs3740938, rs2012390, rs1940475, and rs11225395 were associated with an increased risk of steroid-induced onfh. in further stratification analysis, rs3740938 and rs2012390 displayed a significantly increased risk of steroid-induced onfh in females under the dominant (rs3740938, or = 2.69, 95% ci: 1.50-4.83, p = 0.001; rs2012390, or = 2.30, 95% ci: 1.31-4.03, p = 0.012) and additive (rs3740938, or = 2.02, 95% ci: 1.24-3.29, p = 0.010; rs2012390, or = 1.77, 95% ci: 1.12-2.80, p = 0.047) models. in addition, haplotype ""agtca"" of mmp8 was found to be associated with a 1.40-fold increased risk of steroid-induced onfh (95% ci: 1.04-1.88, p = 0.025).conclusion: our results verify that genetic variants of mmp8 contribute to steroid-induced onfh susceptibility in the population of northern china. in addition, we found that gender differences might interact with mmp8 polymorphisms to contribute to the overall susceptibility to steroid-induced onfh.abbreviations: ci = confidence interval, hwe = hardy-weinberg equilibrium, mmps = matrix metalloproteinases, oa = osteoarthritis, onfh = osteonecrosis of the femoral head, or = odds ratio, snps = single-nucleotide polymorphisms, timps = tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. p values were calculated from 2-sided chi-squared test adjusted for age. † p values were calculated from wald test. ‡ p < 0.05 indicates statistical significance.","Jieli Du, Tianbo Jin, Yuju Cao, Junyu Chen, Yongchang Guo, Mingqi Sun, Jian Li, Xiyang Zhang, Guoqiang Wang, Jianzhong Wang"

10159,"Send Orders for Reprints to reprints@benthamscience.ae The Open Virology Journal Impact of Emerging, Re-Emerging and Zoonotic Viral Infectious Diseases, in a Virologist's Perspective","abstractemerging and re-emerging viral infections have been a major threat to public health worldwide, since their recognition in the late 20th century . these infectious diseases include those caused by newly identified viruses, previously known viruses that acquired additional virulence traits, and those showing spread to unaffected regions. in the last ten years, re-emergence has been noted for zika, ebola, mers, dengue, chikungunya and avian influenza, while sfts (severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome) was recognized to be caused by a novel virus. these diseases are free to move across national borders according to rapid human mobility via global airline network. with this background, any novel infectious disease anywhere in the world may have the potential for global spread.although various factors are considered to be associated with an increase of emerging/ re-emerging infectious diseases , they can be summarized as three major changes on the global level, i.e., (1) change in human/society/behavior, (2) change in environment/ecosystem, and (3) change in microorganisms. these changes are considered to synergistically increase the risks for the emergence of pathogens, transmission of pathogens, and opportunity of infection (susceptible hosts).",Nobumichi Kobayashi
3660,Glial-and Neuronal-Specific Expression of CCL5 mRNA in the Rat Brain,"abstractchemokine (c-c motif) ligand 5 (ccl5) belongs to a group of chemokines that play a role in the peripheral immune system, mostly as chemoattractant molecules, and mediate tactile allodynia. in the central nervous system (cns), ccl5 and its receptors have multiple functions, including promoting neuroinflammation, insulin signaling, neuromodulator of synaptic activity and neuroprotection against a variety of neurotoxins. evidence has also suggested that this chemokine may regulate opioid response. the multifunctional profile of ccl5 might correlate with its ability to bind different chemokine receptors, as well as with its unique cellular expression. in this work, we have used fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with immunohistochemistry to examine the expression profile of ccl5 mrna in the adult rat brain and provide evidence of its cellular localization. we have observed that the highest expression of ccl5 mrna occurs in all major fiber tracts, including the corpus callosum, anterior commissure, and cerebral peduncle. in these tracts, ccl5 mrna was localized in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. astrocytic and microglial expression was also evident in several brain areas including the cerebral cortex, caudate/putamen, hippocampus, and thalamus. furthermore, using a specific neuronal marker, we observed ccl5 mrna expression in discrete layers of the cortex and hippocampus. interestingly, in the midbrain, ccl5 mrna co-localized with tyrosine hydroxylase (th) positive cells of the ventral tegmental area, suggesting that ccl5 might be expressed by a subset of dopaminergic neurons of the mesolimbic system. the expression of ccl5 mrna and protein, together with its receptors, in selected brain cell populations proposes that this chemokine could be involved in neuronal/glial communication.","Maria Fe Lanfranco, Italo Mocchetti, Mark P Burns, Sonia Villapol, Laurent Gautron, Jan Pieter Konsman, Dianne T Langford"

12535,viruses Diagnosis of Feline Infectious Peritonitis: A Review of the Current Literature,"abstractfeline infectious peritonitis (fip) is a fatal disease that poses several challenges for veterinarians: clinical signs and laboratory changes are non-specific, and there are two pathotypes of the etiologic agent feline coronavirus (fcov), sometimes referred to as feline enteric coronavirus (fecv) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv) that vary fundamentally in their virulence, but are indistinguishable by a number of diagnostic methods. this review focuses on all important steps every veterinary practitioner has to deal with and new diagnostic tests that can be considered when encountering a cat with suspected fip with the aim to establish a definitive diagnosis. it gives an overview on all available direct and indirect diagnostic tests and their sensitivity and specificity reported in the literature in different sample material. by providing summarized data for sensitivity and specificity of each diagnostic test and each sample material, which can easily be accessed in tables, this review can help to facilitate the interpretation of different diagnostic tests and raise awareness of their advantages and limitations. additionally, diagnostic trees depict recommended diagnostic steps that should be performed in cats suspected of having fip based on their clinical signs or clinicopathologic abnormalities. these steps can easily be followed in clinical practice.fip occurs most often in young cats under two years of age  . male cats  and certain breeds are suggested to be overrepresented    . clinical signs, such as anorexia, lethargy, weight loss, pyrexia, ocular and neurological signs like gait abnormalities or abnormal mentation, are non-specific      . the same is true for clinicopathologic abnormalities. in general, tests using effusion have much better predictive values than tests using blood  16] . thus, ante mortem diagnosis of fip is especially difficult in cats without significant effusion. since a definitive diagnosis cannot be made based on signalment, history and clinical and laboratory signs alone, these parameters should always be evaluated as an entity and potentially in conjunction with other parameters, such as results of molecular or even more invasive diagnostic tests. in order to avoid falsely diagnosing fip in unaffected cats, specificity is always the most important diagnostic value to consider.hematological abnormalities are very common in cats with fip. reported changes mainly include anemia (non-regenerative as well as regenerative anemia can be present, e.g., immune-mediated hemolytic anemia has been reported), microcytosis with or without anemia, lymphopenia (more commonly in cats with effusion), band neutrophilia (with or without segmented neutrophilia) and thrombocytopenia. whereas microcytosis and band neutrophilia are common features of fip in general, lymphopenia, observed in about 50% of cats with fip, can be seen significantly more commonly in cats with effusion, but is reported only rarely in cats without effusion. the vast majority of cats with fip also have abnormalities upon serum biochemistry. in particular, hyperproteinemia, and especially hyperglobulinemia (that can also be present without an increase in total serum protein), hypoalbuminemia (more common in cats with effusion), hyperbilirubinemia (more common in cats with effusion) and potentially, depending on organ involvement, azotemia (detected more often in cats without effusion) or increased liver enzyme activities can be present. the most common abnormality reported is hyperglobulinemia, documented in about 89% of cats with fip . these changes can occur in variable combinations but it is important to note that they absolutely are neither pathognomonic nor specific for fip, meaning that they can occur in any cat suffering from various diseases with an inflammatory basis, which represent differential diagnoses for fip        . hyperglobulinemia in cats with fip can occur either alone or in combination with hypoalbuminemia or hyperproteinemia. although it has been suggested that the albumin to globulin (a:g) ratio has better diagnostic utility than the gamma-globulin or total protein concentration alone  and several cut-offs have been suggested to potentially rule in (<0.4) or rule out (>0.6-0.8) fip  19,    , the a:g ratio, as other hematological and serum biochemistry changes, should only be interpreted in conjunction with signalment, history, other laboratory parameters and possibly molecular diagnostic methods. elevated gamma-globulin concentrations can be either polyclonal (more common) or monoclonal as differentiated by serum protein electrophoresis  . thus, if a cat presents with any of the aforementioned clinicopathologic abnormalities in routine practice, these always have to be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical, laboratory or imaging findings. they might only support a suspicion of fip if other abnormalities consistent with fip are present as well and fip should never be diagnosed solely on the basis of hematological or biochemical parameters.cats with fip often exhibit markedly increased concentrations of acute phase proteins (app), such as alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (agp), serum amyloid a (saa) or haptoglobin in serum      . still, although these parameters can help in establishing a diagnosis and a negative agp measurement can potentially exclude fip , on their own, they are not pathognomonic for fip. increased concentrations of app can also be found in cats with various other inflammatory conditions, neoplasia or even in healthy fecv-infected cats        . as was stated before for hematological and serum biochemical parameters, measurement of app, such as agp, can only be helpful when interpreted together with other abnormalities in order to provide an index of suspicion of fip in an individual cat  . viruses 2019, 11, 1068 3 of 35the majority of cats with fip present with effusion-specifically, pleural effusion, ascites or a combination of both  13] . even cases of pericardial effusion have been reported  . the typical fluid from a cat with fip is viscous, straw-colored, clear to moderately cloudy and usually forms clots or strings because of its high protein content  . macroscopic and cytologic examination of those effusions and determination of cell count and biochemical parameters is important in order to exclude or confirm other differential diagnoses (such as lymphoma by cytology or bacterial peritonitis or pleuritis by cytology and bacterial culture); but again, changes are not specific for fip  15,    . although typical effusions from cats with fip have a high protein content, low a:g ratio  38] and rather low total cell count  , these findings can also occur in effusions of other etiologies. nevertheless, in a cat which presents with typical signalment, clinical and routine laboratory abnormalities (such as for example a young cat with fever, icterus, anemia, hyperglobulinemia) and effusion, effusion analysis including cytology and bacterial culture, although not completely specific for fip, can exclude other conditions that could confound the diagnosis and can at least help in increasing the pre-test probability for fip.the rivalta's test is a cheap and quick test that can easily be performed on effusions in clinical practice, which is why, in the authors' opinion, it should be included in the diagnostic protocol in every cat with effusion. it has good sensitivity for excluding fip (91-100%), meaning that whenever it is negative, other potential causes for effusion are much more likely than fip. therefore, especially if financial concerns limit the number of diagnostic tests that can be performed, the rivalta's test can at least be used to exclude fip with satisfying negative predictive value with the advantage of no need for any automated analysis. however, its specificity was reported to be only 66-81%  39] . since the rivalta's test is positive most likely secondary to increased amounts of protein and inflammatory mediators in a fluid, it was originally used to differentiate transudates and exudates  , and therefore can also be positive in effusions caused by bacterial peritonitis/pleuritis or lymphoma  . these conditions, however, can usually easily be diagnosed by routine cytology and culture of the effusion, which should also always be performed when analyzing an effusion sample.another test that relies on the abundance of proteins in effusions from cats with fip is the measurement of the delta total nucleated cell count (∆tnc) in an automated hematologic analyzer (sysmex xt-2000iv, sysmex europe, norderstedt, denmark), measuring leucocytes in two different channels. the ratio between both channels, the ∆tnc, is higher in cats with fip than in healthy cats, and its measurement showed quite good diagnostic accuracy. using a cut-off of 1.7 for ∆tnc, diagnostic sensitivity of the method was 79-90%; specificity was 94-100%. higher cut-offs of 2.5 or 3.4 even increased specificity to 100% .neurological signs are more likely to occur in the population of cats with fip without significant effusion  . the csf is often sampled after diagnostic imaging of the central nervous system in order to reach a diagnosis. upon clinicopathological examination, an increased protein content and pleocytosis can be noted in the csf of cats with fip      . csf cytology often reveals a mixed or suppurative inflammation; mononuclear infiltration can be seen as well. unremarkable csf cytology can also occur  . however, all these changes can also be present in cats with other neurologic diseases, and some cats with neurological signs caused by fip have normal csf analysis .eye involvement, which includes pyogranulomatous and granulomatous uveitis and chorioretinitis with a mixed uveal inflammatory cell infiltrate and predominance of b lymphocytes and plasma cells    , was reported in up to 29% of cats with confirmed fip  . aqueocentesis can provide viruses 2019, 11, 1068 4 of 35 aqueous humor for cytological and clinicopathological testing; however, cytology is often non-diagnostic or more useful to diagnose lymphoma    .fcov infection leads to the production of specific antibodies, independently of the development of fip    . after experimental infection, serum antibodies are detectable as early as seven to 28 days after infection  6, 54,     .the first assay to detect anti-fcov antibodies was developed in 1976  . by now, there are a number of different test methods: indirect immunofluorescence antibody tests (ifat) using either fcov    or transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev) -65] as antigen, virus neutralization (vn) assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisa)  and rapid immunochromatographic tests (rim) . an ideal test should work on different fluids, such as serum and effusion, have high sensitivity and specificity, should allow the use of small sample quantities, provide a quantitative value and a rapid result. for excluding a diagnosis of fip (if at all possible by antibody detection), all of these aspects matter. for fcov screening, especially sensitivity and test rapidity are important .","Sandra

3421,Humanized Mouse Models of Epstein-Barr Virus Infection and Associated Diseases,"abstractepstein-barr virus (ebv) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus infecting more than 90% of the adult population of the world. ebv is associated with a variety of diseases including infectious mononucleosis, lymphoproliferative diseases, malignancies such as burkitt lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (ra). ebv in nature infects only humans, but in an experimental setting, a limited species of new-world monkeys can be infected with the virus. small animal models, suitable for evaluation of novel therapeutics and vaccines, have not been available. humanized mice, defined here as mice harboring functioning human immune system components, are easily infected with ebv that targets cells of the hematoimmune system. furthermore, humanized mice can mount both cellular and humoral immune responses to ebv. thus, many aspects of human ebv infection, including associated diseases (e.g., lymphoproliferative disease, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and erosive arthritis resembling ra), latent infection, and t-cell-mediated and humoral immune responses have been successfully reproduced in humanized mice. here we summarize recent achievements in the field of humanized mouse models of ebv infection and show how they have been utilized to analyze ebv pathogenesis and normal and aberrant human immune responses to the virus.154mice have played a central role in biomedical researches including those on infectious diseases, as an easily accessible and versatile animal model. abundant knowledge of their genetics promoted their use as a model system. many human viruses, however, do not infect mice. although murine viruses such as the mouse herpesvirus 68 (mhv-68) that is related to epstein-barr virus (ebv) and kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv), and murine cytomegalovirus (cmv) homologous to human cmv have been considered as models of human viruses, there are considerable diversity in biological activity and pathogenesis between murine and human viruses -3]. introduction of transgenes encoding virus receptors to mice enabled viruses such as adenoviruses , measles virus , coronavirus  7] , and hepatitis c virus , to infect mice, but this approach did not remove the species barrier in many other viruses including human immunodeficiency virus 1 (hiv-1). a breakthrough in this issue was brought by the development of the scid-hu thy/liv mouse and the scid-hu pbl mouse in 1988 both of which are based on the c.b-17 scid mouse. due to a mutation in the gene coding for a subunit of the dna-dependent protein kinase that is essential for recombination of both the t-cell and b-cell receptor genes, c.b-17-scid mice lack both t and b cells and do not have the ability to reject human tissues and cells  . scid-hu thy/liv mice were prepared by transplanting tissues of human fetal thymus and liver into the renal capsule of c.b-17 scid mice and allowed de novo generation of human t cells including the cd4 + compartment  . scid-hu thy/liv mice were primarily used as an in vivo model of hiv-1 infection that targets mainly cd4 + t cells and monocytes/macrophages. in addition, scid-hu thy/liv mice were used for modeling of human herpesvirus 6 , human cytomegalovirus , kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) infections , measles virus  , and varicellazoster virus  . various key features of human hiv-1 infection, including selective depletion of cd4 + t cells, were reproduced in scid-hu thy/liv mice    . scid-hu pbl mice, on the other hand, were prepared by transplanting human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) to the peritoneal cavity of c.b-17 scid mice and efficient engraftment of most components of the human immune system including t and b cells was observed  . scid-hu pbl mice were used for modeling of hiv-1, human t-lymphotropic virus 1 (htlv-1), and ebv infections and recapitulated many features of their pathogenesis     . there were, however, limitations in these early-generation humanized mouse models: human lymphocytes generated in scid-hu thy/liv mice did not distribute systemically and therefore intrathymic or intranodal hiv-1 inoculation was necessary and virus infection was mostly confined in the inoculated organs; scid-hu pbl mice were prone to graft versus host disease; both scidhu thy/liv and scid-hu pbl mice did not mount primary immune responses to viruses. these disadvantages were overcome in new-generation humanized mice developed in this decade     . new-generation humanized mice were prepared by transplanting human hematopoietic stem cells (hsc) to mice of various severely immunodeficient strains (e.g., nod/shi-scid il2rg null (nog), balb/c rag2 −/− il2rg −/− (brg), and nod/ltsz-scid il2rg −/− (nsg)) and major components of the human immune system, including t cells, b cells, nk cells, dendritic cells, and monocytes/macrophages, were reconstituted. in one protocol (blt (bone marrow, liver, thymus) mouse), tissues of human fetal liver and thymus, as well as hsc derived from the same liver were transplanted and enabled proper intrathymic selection of human t cells  . these new-generation humanized mice can be infected with ebv -31], hiv-1 -36], htlv-1 -39], dengue virus , herpes simplex","Shigeyoshi Fujiwara, Ken-Ichi Imadome"

8849,Metabolic host response and therapeutic approaches to influenza infection,"abstractbased on available metabolomic studies, influenza infection affects a variety of cellular metabolic pathways to ensure an optimal environment for its replication and production of viral particles. following infection, glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis increase in infected cells continually, which results in higher glucose consumption. the pentose phosphate shunt, as another glucose-consuming pathway, is enhanced by influenza infection to help produce more nucleotides, especially atp. regarding lipid species, following infection, levels of triglycerides, phospholipids, and several lipid derivatives undergo perturbations, some of which are associated with inflammatory responses. also, mitochondrial fatty acid βoxidation decreases significantly simultaneously with an increase in biosynthesis of fatty acids and membrane lipids. moreover, essential amino acids are demonstrated to decline in infected tissues due to the production of large amounts of viral and cellular proteins. immune responses against influenza infection, on the other hand, could significantly affect metabolic pathways. mainly, interferon (ifn) production following viral infection affects cell function via alteration in amino acid synthesis, membrane composition, and lipid metabolism. understanding metabolic alterations required for influenza virus replication has revealed novel therapeutic methods based on targeted inhibition of these cellular metabolic pathways.","Mohsen Keshavarz, Farid Solaymani-Mohammadi, Haideh Namdari, Yaser Arjeini, Mohammad Javad Mousavi, Farhad Rezaei"

6022,Article 218 Electronic Health Record Analysis of First Opinion Veterinary Practices,"abstractcanine acute diarrhoea is frequently observed in first opinion practice, though little is known about commonly used diagnostic or therapeutic management plans, including use of antimicrobials. this retrospective observational study utilised electronic health records augmented with practitioner-completed questionnaires from 3,189 cases (3,159 dogs) collected from 179 volunteer veterinary practices between april 2014 and january 2017. we used multivariable analysis to explore factors potentially associated with pharmaceutical agent prescription, and resolution of clinical signs by 10 days post-initial presentation. use of bacteriological and/or parasitological diagnostic tests were uncommon (3.2% of cases, 95% confidence interval, ci, 2.4-4.0), though systemic antimicrobials were the most commonly prescribed pharmaceutical agents (49.7% of cases, 95% ci 46.1-53.2). such prescription was associated with haemorrhagic diarrhoea (odds ratio, or, 4.1; 95% ci 3.4-5.0), body temperature in excess of 39.0 • c, or moderate/severe cases (or 1.3, 95% ci 1.1-1.7). gastrointestinal agents (e.g., antacids) were prescribed to 37.7% of cases (95% ci 35.4-39.9), and were most frequently prescribed to vomiting dogs regardless of presence (or 46.4, or absence of blood (or 17.1, 95% ci 13.4-21.9). endoparasiticides/endectocides were prescribed to 7.8% of cases (95% ci 6.8-9.0), such prescription being less frequent for moderate/severe cases (or 0.5, 95% ci 0.4-0.7), though more frequent when weight loss was recorded (or 3.4, 95% ci 1.3-9.0). gastrointestinal nutraceuticals (e.g., probiotics) were dispensed to 60.8% of cases (95% ci 57.1-64.6), these cases less frequently presenting with moderate/severe clinical signs (or 0.6, 95% ci 0.5-0.8). nearly a quarter of cases were judged lost to follow-up (n=754). insured (or 0.7, 95% ci 0.5-0.9); neutered (or 0.4, 95% ci 0.3-0.5), or vaccinated dogs (or 0.3, 95% ci 0.3-0.4) were less commonly lost to follow-up. of remaining dogs, clinical signs were deemed resolved in 95.4% of cases (95% ci 94.6-96.2). provision of dietary modification advice and gastrointestinal nutraceuticals alone were positively associated with resolution (or 2.8, 95% ci 1.3-6.1); no such associations were found for pharmaceutical agents, including antimicrobials. hence, this study supports the view that antimicrobials are largely unnecessary for acute diarrhoea cases; this being of particular importance when considering the global threat posed by antimicrobial resistance.","Miguel Ángel Moreno, Ana Luisa, Pereira Mateus, Alejandro Dorado García, David A Singleton, P J M Noble, Fernando Sánchez-Vizcaíno, Susan Dawson, Gina L Pinchbeck, Nicola J Williams, Alan D Radford, Philip H Jones"
9775,Fatal Community-acquired Pneumonia in Children Caused by Re-emergent Human Adenovirus 7d Associated with Higher Severity of Illness and Fatality Rate,"abstracthuman adenoviruses (hadvs) are highly contagious pathogens causing acute respiratory disease (ard), such as community-acquired pneumonia. hadv-7d, a re-emergent genomic variant, has been recently reported in asia and the united states after a several-decade absence. however, whether hadv-7d is associated with higher severity than other types is currently unclear. in this study, the clinical and epidemiological investigation showed that fever, cough, and sore throat were the three most common respiratory symptoms of hadv infections. hadv-7 caused longer duration of fever, higher morbidity of tachypnea/dyspnea, pleural effusion, diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly, consciousness alteration, as well as higher rates of pneumonia, mechanical ventilation and higher fatality rate (28.6%) than other types, particularly hadv-3 and hadv-2. the genomes of seven hadv-7d isolates from mild, severe, and fatal cases were sequenced and highly similar with each other. surprisingly, two isolates (2011, 2012) had 100% identical genomes with an earlier strain from a fatal ard outbreak in china (2009), which elucidates the virus origin and confirms the unexpected hadv genomic conservation and stability. phylogenetic analysis indicated that l1 52/55-kda dna packaging protein may be associated with the higher severity of illness and fatality rate of hadv-7. clinicians need to be aware of hadvs in children with ard.","Zhiwu Yu, Zhiwei Zeng, Jing Zhang, Yuxian Pan, Manjun Chen, Yonghui Guo, Nan Yu, James Chodosh, Ning Fu, Xiaoyan Che, Qiwei Zhang"

3011,Novel insights into endogenous RNA viral elements in Ixodes scapularis and other arbovirus vector genomes,"abstractmany emerging arboviruses are not transmitted by traditional mosquito vectors, but by lesser-studied arthropods such as ticks, midges, and sand flies. small rna (srna) silencing pathways are the main antiviral defence mechanism for arthropods, which lack adaptive immunity. non-retroviral integrated rna virus sequences (nirvs) are one potential source of srnas which comprise these pathways. nirvs are remnants of past germline rna viral infections, where viral cdna integrates into the host genome and is vertically transmitted. in aedes mosquitoes, nirvs are widespread and produce piwi-interacting rnas (pirnas). these are hypothesised to target incoming viral transcripts to modulate viral titre, perhaps rendering the organism a more efficient arbovirus vector. to explore the nirvs landscape in alternative arbovirus vectors, we validated the nirvs landscape in aedes spp. and then identified novel nirvs in six medically relevant arthropods and also in drosophila melanogaster. we identified novel nirvs in phlebotomus papatasi, culicoides sonorensis, rhipicephalus microplus, anopheles gambiae, culex quinquefasciatus, and ixodes scapularis. due to their unexpected abundance, we further characterised nirvs in the blacklegged tick i. scapularis (n = 143). interestingly, nirvs are not enriched in r. microplus, another hard tick, suggesting this is an ixodes-specific adaptation. i. scapularis nirvs are enriched in bunya-and orthomyxo-like sequences, reflecting that ticks are a dominant host for these virus groups. unlike in mosquitoes, i. scapularis nirvs are more commonly derived from the nonstructural region (replicase) of negative-sense viruses, as opposed to structural regions (e.g. glycoprotein). like other arthropods, i. scapularis nirvs preferentially integrate into genomic pirna clusters, and serve as a template for primary pirna production in the commonly used embryonic i. scapularis ise6 cell line. interestingly, we identified a two-fold enrichment of nonlong terminal repeat (non-ltr) retrotransposons, in genomic proximity to nirvs, contrasting with studeis in ae. aegypti, where ltr retrotransposons are instead associated with nirvs formation. we characterised nirvs phylogeny and integration patterns in the important vector, i. scapularis, revealing they are distinct from those in aedes spp. future studies will explore the possible antiviral mechanism conferred by nirvs to i. scapularis,which may help the transmission of pathogenic arboviruses. finally, this study explored nirvs as an untapped wealth of viral diversity in arthropods.","Alice G Russo, Andrew G Kelly, Daniel Enosi Tuipulotu, Mark M Tanaka, Peter A White"
9400,Epidemiology and Infection Post-pandemic influenza A/H1N1pdm09 is associated with more severe outcomes than A/H3N2 and other respiratory viruses in adult hospitalisations,"abstractthis study compares the frequency and severity of influenza a/h1n1pdm09 (a/h1), influenza a/h3n2 (a/h3) and other respiratory virus infections in hospitalised patients. data from 17 332 adult hospitalised patients admitted to sir charles gairdner hospital, perth, western australia, with a respiratory illness between 2012 and 2015 were linked with data containing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results for respiratory viruses including a/h1, a/h3, influenza b, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza. of these, 1753 (10.1%) had test results. multivariable regression analyses were conducted to compare the viruses for clinical outcomes including icu admission, ventilation, pneumonia, length of stay and death. patients with a/h1 were more likely to experience severe outcomes such as icu admission (or 2.5, 95% ci 1.2-5.5, p = 0.016), pneumonia (or 3.0, 95% ci 1.6-5.7, p < 0.001) and lower risk of discharge from hospital (indicating longer lengths of hospitalisation; hr 0.64 95% ci 0.47-0.88, p = 0.005), than patients with a/h3. patients with a non-influenza respiratory virus were less likely to experience severe clinical outcomes than patients with a/h1, however, had similar likelihood when compared to patients with a/h3. patients hospitalised with a/h1 had higher odds of severe outcomes than patients with a/h3 or other respiratory viruses. knowledge of circulating influenza strains is important for healthcare preparedness.","C A Minney-Smith, L A Selvey, A Levy, D W Smith"
11170,De novo Fatty Acid Biosynthesis Contributes Significantly to Establishment of a Bioenergetically Favorable Environment for Vaccinia Virus Infection,"abstractthe poxvirus life cycle, although physically autonomous from the host nucleus, is nevertheless dependent upon cellular functions. a requirement for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis was implied by our previous demonstration that cerulenin, a fatty acid synthase inhibitor, impaired vaccinia virus production. here we show that additional inhibitors of this pathway, tofa and c75, reduce viral yield significantly, with partial rescue provided by exogenous palmitate, the pathway's endproduct. palmitate's major role during infection is not for phospholipid synthesis or protein palmitoylation. instead, the mitochondrial import and b-oxidation of palmitate are essential, as shown by the impact of etomoxir and trimetazidine, which target these two processes respectively. moreover, the impact of these inhibitors is exacerbated in the absence of exogenous glucose, which is otherwise dispensable for infection. in contrast to glucose, glutamine is essential for productive viral infection, providing intermediates that sustain the tca cycle (anaplerosis). cumulatively, these data suggest that productive infection requires the mitochondrial b-oxidation of palmitate which drives the tca cycle and energy production. additionally, infection causes a significant rise in the cellular oxygen consumption rate (atp synthesis) that is ablated by etomoxir. the biochemical progression of the vaccinia life cycle is not impaired in the presence of tofa, c75, or etomoxir, although the levels of viral dna and proteins synthesized are somewhat diminished. however, by reversibly arresting infections at the onset of morphogenesis, and then monitoring virus production after release of the block, we determined that virion assembly is highly sensitive to tofa and c75. electron microscopic analysis of cells released into c75 revealed fragmented aggregates of viroplasm which failed to be enclosed by developing virion membranes. taken together, these data indicate that vaccinia infection, and in particular virion assembly, relies on the synthesis and mitochondrial import of fatty acids, where their b-oxidation drives robust atp production. citation: greseth md, traktman p (2014) de novo fatty acid biosynthesis contributes significantly to establishment of a bioenergetically favorable environment for vaccinia virus infection. plos pathog 10(3): e1004021.","Matthew D Greseth, Paula Traktman, James C Alwine"
11536,Conservation implications of primate trade in China over 18 years based on web news reports of confiscations,"abstractprimate species have been increasingly threatened by legal and illegal trade in china, mainly for biomedical research or as pets and traditional medicine, yet most reports on trade from china regard international trade. to assess a proxy for amount of national primate trades, we quantified the number of reports of native primate species featuring in unique web news reports from 2000 to 2017, including accuracy of their identification, location where they were confiscated or rescued, and their condition upon rescue. to measure temporal trends across these categories, the time span was divided into three sections: 2000-2005, 2006-2011 and 2012-2017. a total of 735 individuals of 14 species were reported in 372 news reports, mostly rhesus macaques (n = 165, 22.5%, macaca mulatta) and two species of slow lorises (n = 487, 66.3%, nycticebus spp.). during the same period, live individuals of rhesus macaques were recorded 206 times (70,949 individuals) in the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora trade database, whereas slow lorises were only recorded four times (nine individuals), indicating that the species originated illegally from china or were illegally imported into china. due to their rescued locations in residential areas (n = 211, 56.7%), most primates appeared to be housed privately as pets. a higher proportion of 'market' rescues during 2006-2011 (w 2 = 8.485, df = 2, p = 0.014), could be partly attributed to an intensive management on wildlife markets since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2003. more than half (68.3%, 502 individuals) of the primate individuals were unhealthy, injured or dead when rescued. thus, identification and welfare training and capacity-building should be provided to husbandry and veterinary professionals, as well as education to the public through awareness initiatives. the increase in presence of some species, especially slow lorises, with a declining population in restricted areas, also suggests the urgent need for public awareness about the illegal nature of keeping these taxa as pets.","Qingyong Ni, Yu Wang, Ariana Weldon, Meng Xie, Huailiang Xu, Yongfang Yao, Mingwang Zhang, Ying Li, Yan Li, Bo Zeng, K A I Nekaris"
10762,"Predicted protein interactions of IFITMs may shed light on mechanisms of Zika virus-induced microcephaly and host invasion [version 2; referees: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved] Referee Status: Invited Referees version 2 , University of Amendments from Version 1","abstractafter the first reported case of zika virus (zikv) in brazil, in 2015, a significant increase in the reported cases of microcephaly was observed. microcephaly is a neurological condition in which the infant's head is significantly smaller with complications in brain development. recently, two small membrane-associated interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (ifitm1 and ifitm3) have been shown to repress members of the flaviviridae family which includes zikv. however, the exact mechanisms leading to the inhibition of the virus are yet unknown. here, we assembled an interactome of ifitm1 and ifitm3 with known protein-protein interactions (ppis) collected from publicly available databases and novel ppis predicted using the high-confidence protein-protein interaction prediction (hippip) model. we analyzed the functional and pathway associations of the interacting proteins, and found that there are several immunity pathways (toll-like receptor signaling, cd28 signaling in t-helper cells, crosstalk between dendritic cells and natural killer cells), neuronal pathways (axonal guidance signaling, neural tube closure and actin cytoskeleton signaling) and developmental pathways (neural tube closure, embryonic skeletal system development) that are associated with these interactors. our novel ppis associate cilia dysfunction in ependymal cells to microcephaly, and may also shed light on potential targets of zikv for host invasion by immunosuppression and cytoskeletal rearrangements. these results could help direct future research in elucidating the mechanisms underlying host defense to zikv and other flaviviruses.we have added a brief description about hippip, the computational method that was employed to predict proteinprotein interactions. this method has been described in detail in our prior publication (npj schizophrenia 2pubmed abstract | publisher full text 2. valadão al, aguiar rs, de arruda lb: interplay between inflammation and cellular stress triggered by flaviviridae viruses. front microbiol. 2016;

371,"A quantitative narrative on movement, disease and patch exploitation in nesting agent groups","abstractanimal relocation data has recently become considerably more ubiquitous, finely structured (collection frequencies measured in minutes) and co-variate rich (physiology of individuals, environmental and landscape information, and accelerometer data). to better understand the impacts of ecological interactions, individual movement and disease on global change ecology, including wildlife management and conservation, it is important to have simulators that will provide demographic, movement, and epidemiology null models against which to compare patterns observed in empirical systems. such models may then be used to develop quantitative narratives that enhance our intuition and understanding of the relationship between population structure and generative processes: in essence, along with empirical and experimental narratives, quantitative narratives are used to advance ecological epistemology. here we describe a simulator that accounts for the influence of consumer-resource interactions, existence of social groups anchored around a central location, territoriality, group-switching behavior, and disease dynamics on population size. we use this simulator to develop new and reinforce existing quantitative narratives and point out areas for future study.the health and viability of species are of considerable concern to all nature lovers. population models are central to our efforts to assess the numerical and ecological status of species and threats posed by climate change. models, however, are crude caricatures of complex ecological systems. so how do we construct reliable assessment models able to capture processes essential to predicating the impacts of global change on population viability without getting tied up in their vast complexities? we broach this question and demonstrate how models focusing at the level of the individual (i.e., agent-based models) are tools for developing robust, narratives to augment narratives arising purely from empirical data sources and experimental outcomes. we do this in the context of nesting social groups, foraging for food, while exhibiting territoriality and group-switching behavior; and, we evaluate the impact of disease on the viability of such populations. 7 laboratory at the microcosm scale , but for populations of most vertebrates such 8 microcosm studies are not applicable, and we need to resort to the mesocosm level  or 9 use alternative methods to obtain insights. one of these methods is to build simulation 10 models that incorporate demographic, spatial, movement, and other relevant behavioral 11 and community processes, and then compare simulations of these models across various 12 scenarios  or outcomes with and without epidemiological processes added to the mix. 13 we take this latter approach and our primary aim is to develop a tool that can be used 14 to study the impact of disease on colonial populations and metapopulations  . this 15 tool must be comprehensive enough to include critical processes needed to address 16 questions that will extend our current knowledge in significant ways. its application, of 17 course, is limited by the structure of the model. thus, in building the model, we are 18 guided by principles related to concepts of ""appropriate complexity modeling""  12] .the standard approach to modeling disease outbreaks caused by 20 directly-transmitted pathogens is through systems of differential or difference equations 21 that model the number or density of susceptible (s), infectious (i), and recovered or 22 removed (r) individuals  14]. these formulations may either be deterministic or 23 stochastic, and elaborated to include time-delays , demographic (births, deaths, and 24 recruitment ), metapopulation  and other spatial processes . examples of 25 these elaborations can be found in the context of modeling, inter alia, influenza  20], 26 measles , sars  23], and ebola -28] outbreaks.27 systems approaches to modeling disease limit our ability to consider individual-level 28 traits, unless these traits can be reasonably well expressed by dividing the population 29 into a limited number of subgroups, such as groups of individuals infected with different 30 strains of pathogens . including individual-level variation in disease models, however, 31 requires an agent-based approach , which then allows both individual behavior (e.g., 32 relevant to evaluating the probability of pathogen transmission) and pathogen exposure 33 history (e.g., relevant to evaluating the immunological state and hence the susceptibility 34 of an individual) to be incorporated into the model. it also allows one to trace the 35 number of individuals the each pathogen infects  and, hence, to identify individuals 36 that may be acting as super-spreaders .here, we develop an agent-based formulation that has application to studying 38 disease outbreaks in wildlife populations whose state of health-and hence, 39 susceptibility-is impacted by various factors, including social factors related to group 40 living and the structure of social networks , ecological factors related to foraging 41 success, and the movement behavior of individuals (which influences exposure to 42 pathogens). the model also includes a periodic return to a colony or nest cell, which 43 implies that the model has both a population-level and a group-association level (core 44 or household) structure. such models have applications in animal production systems 45 (e.g., managing foot and mouth disease ), wildlife conservation , and disease 46 management at the human-animal interface . the latter involves diseases such as 47 anthrax , bovine tuberculosis , and brucellosis in cattle and wild ungulates , 48 chronic wasting disease in deer , and toxoplasmosis in rats, cats and humans . 49 rather then following a formulaic odd (overview, design concepts, and design 50 details;  40]) or extended odd  prescription in presenting our model, we take a 51 more expository approach by first crafting a broad outline of our model's general 52 october 1, 2019 2/28 all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.the copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. .  doi: biorxiv preprint features. in addition, to keep the paper reader-friendly, we relegate the mathematical 53 details of our model to a technical methods section at the end of the paper and the 54 algorithmic details to a supporting online file (sof). in the results section, we report 55 the results of simulations of several illustrative scenarios, and in the discussion section 56 we present the findings in the form of a quantitative narrative that provides insights 57 into the role different processes play in creating the population patterns observed in our 58 simulations.at this point, a few brief remarks on quantitative narratives in disease ecology are in 60 order. unlike the canonical theories of physics-with kinematics, electromagnetism, 61 general relativity, and quantum mechanics providing prime examples, ecology has no 62 fundamental theories and associated mathematical formulations that can be used to 63 develop an ecological epistemology. rather, the complexity of the field induced by the 64 plethora of processes involved requires that we focus only on a limited number of these 65 processes when building models, where the selection of process depends on the questions 66 at hand . our understanding of these processes requires an analysis of associated 67 quantitative formulations, but the soundness of the arguments cannot be adjudicated by 68 comparing, say, the accuracy of mercury's orbit as predicted by newtonian versus 69 einsteinian physics. rather, ecological epistemology is woven from a collection of 70 quantitative narratives that provide current best explanations for, or fits to, observed 71 empirical and experimental data. while statistical null models are use to develop 72 consilient empirical and experimental narratives, dynamic null models are used to 73 develop quantitative narratives that are consilient with empirical and experimental 74 narratives (fig. 1). such dynamic null models have a goldilocks quality in the sense of 75 containing just the right amount of biological process detail : too little and model 76 simulations are rejected as providing adequate descriptions of observed data; too much 77 process detail and the null-model-parsimony principle, as discussed by gotteli and 78 graves ( , p. 6), is violated. 79 fig 1. a sketch of the role of empirical, experimental and quantitative narratives in the formulation of canons and construction of syntheses in the development of an ecological epistemology.in ecology, quantitative narratives, derived from the gause-lotka-volterra 80 competition model, were used to construct the concept of a niche . this narrative 81 begins with insights into competitive exclusion  45], supported by additional 82 quantitative ideas relating to niche breadth and overlap  47]. in epidemiology, 83 quantitative narratives, derived from analyses of seir epidemic models (s: susceptible; 84 e: exposed but not yet infectious; i: infections; r: removed-that is, recovered with 85 immunity or dead)  , have been used to identify critical differences in the emergence 86 of outbreak thresholds depending on whether pathogen transmission is dependent on quantitative narratives in epidemiology that incorporate aspects of the movement of 89 individuals  or particular ecological processes have been used to develop canonical 90 theories ; however, these are limited in scope and generality by the analytical 91 difficulties of studying dynamical systems, as well as networks that include more than 92 one ecological or behavioral process. the challenge here is to keep the models somewhat 93 general and broadly applicable, while including several key processes such as: spatial 94 demography; consumer-resource ecology with associated reproduction, growth, stress, 95 and mortality processes; movement and contact behavior; and seir epidemiology, in 96 ways that are simple enough to interpret the effects of each process. sensitivity analyses 97 provide one type of approach to separating out effects . another is to use 98 methods relating to the practice of appropriate complexity modeling  12] .2 methodsthe model we present here only incorporates the focal processes of interest and those 101 needed to attain a level of realism required to adequately address the questions at hand. 102 thus, for example, we do not include agent age structure in the model even though age 103 structure is known to have important effects on population growth patterns , 104 persistence , and epidemics . agent age structure would certainly add complexity 105 to our narratives; but, whether its impacts are critical (i.e., it qualitatively changes the 106 structures we explain) or only elaborative (i.e., has quantitative but not qualitative 107 implications regarding the questions asked) is a issue to be examined in future studies. 108 for clarity, we enumerate below-without mathematical details-the processes 109 incorporated in our model, leaving such details to the technical methods section at the 110 end of the paper. aspects of the numerus model builder construction of the model and 111 the generated novascript (extended javascript language) implementation are provided 112 in a supporting information file. 113 2.1 model outline 114the model is formulated as a set of agents (individuals) moving over a cellular array.the agents themselves can be differentiated with respect to type (e.g., sex), can undergo 116 discrete state transitions (e.g., disease state) and can also change continuously over time 117 with respect an agent-level state vector. in our case, the latter contains the variables 118 ""mass"" (also a surrogate for fitness) and ""stress"" (which accumulates when the individual 119 is unable to meet its resource needs each time period). the cells in the cellular array 120 may also have relatively complex states that, in our model, include a list of the agents 121 in each cell and the level of a dynamically responding resource, which determines the 122 environmental context for the agents. movement of agents occurs under the assumption 123 that, apart from reproduction, ecological and epidemiological processes are independent 124 of agent type. more specifically, in our model, the following objects and concepts apply: 125 simulation world. this is the set of agents moving over a hexagonal cellular array 126 (we use a toroidal topology to eliminate boundary effects).","Wayne M Getz, Richard Salter, Krti Tallam"
9386,Citation: Interactions Between Enteroviruses and the Inflammasome: New Insights Into Viral Pathogenesis,"abstractenteroviruses (evs) have emerged a substantial threat to public health. evs infection range from mild to severe disease, including mild respiratory illness, diarrhea, poliomyelitis, hand, foot, and mouth disease, aseptic meningitis, and encephalitis. in the asia-pacific region, for example, one of the best studied enterovirus 71 (ev71) has been associated with pandemics of hand, foot, and mouth disease (hfmd) in children, particularly those under the age of five. serious hfmd cases are associated with neurological complications, such as aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, brainstem encephalitis, and have been associated with as many as 1000s of deaths in children and infants from 2008 to 2017, in china. more than 90% of laboratory confirmed deaths due to hmfd are associated with ev71. however, little is known about the pathogenesis of evs. studies have reported that evs-infected patients with severe complications show elevated serum concentrations of il-1β. the secretion of il-1β is mediated by nlrp3 inflammasome during ev71 and cvb3 infection. enteroviruses 2b and 3d proteins play an important role in activation of nlrp3 inflammasome, while 3c and 2a play important roles in antagonizing the activation of nlrp3 and the secretion of il-1β. in this review, we summarize current knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms that underlie the activation and regulation of the nlrp3 inflammasome, particularly how viral proteins regulate nlrp3 inflammasome activation. these insights into the relationship between the nlrp3 inflammasome and the pathogenesis of evs infection may ultimately inform the development of novel antiviral drugs.","Akio Adachi, Qibin Leng, Julie Mcauley, Xiaobo Lei, Jianwei Wang, Xiao X , Qi J , Lei X , Wang J , Xia Xiao, Jianli Qi"
3834,molecules Developing Novel G-Quadruplex Ligands: From Interaction with Nucleic Acids to Interfering with Nucleic Acid-Protein Interaction,"abstractg-quadruplex is a special secondary structure of nucleic acids in guanine-rich sequences of genome. g-quadruplexes have been proved to be involved in the regulation of replication, dna damage repair, and transcription and translation of oncogenes or other cancer-related genes. therefore, targeting g-quadruplexes has become a novel promising anti-tumor strategy. different kinds of small molecules targeting the g-quadruplexes have been designed, synthesized, and identified as potential anti-tumor agents, including molecules directly bind to the g-quadruplex and molecules interfering with the binding between the g-quadruplex structures and related binding proteins. this review will explore the feasibility of g-quadruplex ligands acting as anti-tumor drugs, from basis to application. meanwhile, since helicase is the most well-defined g-quadruplex-related protein, the most extensive research on the relationship between helicase and g-quadruplexes, and its meaning in drug design, is emphasized. molecules 2019, 24, 396 2 of 29the search for and further optimization of compounds targeting the g-quadruplexes may lead to compounds of increasing specificity and drug potential . however, compared to developing inhibitors for a specific enzyme or protein, selective interaction with the g-quadruplex structures in particular genome regions is difficult to achieve. an alternative strategy for discovering novel g-quadruplex-related compounds is to interfere with the binding between g-quadruplex-forming sequences and the binding proteins . considering the fact that the shifts between various secondary structures in nucleic acids actually are regulated by several proteins binding to the nucleic acids , this alternative strategy seems attractive. therefore, we will further discuss the proteins that interact with g-quadruplexes, including both stabilizing and dissociating proteins, based on emerging findings regarding this kind of binding proteins.in addition, the helicases are a class of molecular motor proteins that unwind dnas or rnas using the energy produced by the hydrolysis of nucleotide triphosphates (ntp) . helicases play essential roles in nucleic acid metabolism by facilitating cellular processes including replication, recombination, dna repair, and transcription . furthermore, several members of the helicase family have the ability to regulate the degradation of g-quadruplexes, and subsequently regulate related biological processes to achieve anti-cancer effects . small molecules with influence on the function of g-quadruplexes via helicase have been discovered, developed, and well-evaluated . therefore, we hope to focus on the progress made in helicase-related leading compounds to give a comprehensive view of this field.a g-tetrad structure in guanylic acid, according to x-ray diffraction data, was first reported by gellert et al. in 1962 . twenty years later, studies showed that the g-quadruplex structure can form in g-rich repeats at the ends of telomeres . by immunostaining the telomeric g-quadruplexes using a specific antibody, g-quadruplex structures were proven in 2001 to be formed in cells . from then on, several g-quadruplex-specific single-chain antibodies (scfv antibody) have been developed using different display processes, and these scfv antibodies have been used in dna or rna g-quadruplex mapping in cells . combined with next-generation sequencing, genome mapping and thorough functional elucidation have been reported  . all these results support the existence of g-quadruplex structures in the genome.the g-quadruplex structure is a stacked secondary structure that can form in a specific repetitive sequence of g-rich dna or rna. the core structures in the g-quadruplex are two or three g-quartets, which form from four guanines via hoogsteen hydrogen bonds. in addition, the g-quadruplex is stabilized by univalent metal cations (na + or k + ) located in the central channel of the plane (figure 1 ). g-quadruplex structures may form intramolecular g-quadruplexes within a single dna strand, or intermolecular g-quadruplexes between multiple dna strands . moreover, due to the various orientations of nucleic acids strands during folding, the g-quadruplex structures can further divide into different conformations, including parallel, antiparallel, and hybrid conformations ( figure 2) . generally, the configuration and stability of the g-quadruplex structures are related to the length and the composition of the g-quadruplex-forming sequence, the length of the annulus structure between gs, the number of dna strands, and the type of binding cations .","Zhi-Yin Sun, Xiao-Na Wang, Sui-Qi Cheng, Xiao-Xuan Su, Tian-Miao Ou"
10536,Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 regulation of SDF-1/CXCR4 axis: implications for cardiovascular disease,"abstractdipeptidyl peptidase-4 (dpp4) is a ubiquitously expressed protease that regulates diverse number of physiological functions. as a dipeptidase, it exerts its catalytic effects on proteins/peptides with proline, alanine, or serine in the penultimate (p1) amino acid residue from the amino terminus. the evidence to date supports an important effect of dpp4 in catalytic cleavage of incretin peptides and this perhaps represents the main mechanism by which dpp4 inhibition improves glycemic control. dpp4 also plays an important role in the degradation of multiple chemokines of which stromal cell-derived factor-1 (sdf-1, also known as cxcl12) is perhaps an increasingly recognized target, given its importance in processes, such as hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, and stem cell homing. in the current review, we will summarize the importance of dpp4-mediated enzymatic processing of cytokines/chemokines with an emphasis on sdf-1 and resultant implications for cardiovascular physiology and disease.dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (dpp4) is a type-ii integral transmembrane glycoprotein that has recently gained attention owing to its role in the catalytic degradation of incretins and as a receptor for entry for the middle eastern respiratory syndrome (mers) virus. dpp4 is best known for its catalytic function, whereby it proteolytically cleaves a number of peptide and protein substrates. it exhibits a strong preference for peptides with proline, serine, or alanine as the penultimate amino acid from the amino terminus. the n-terminus of glucagon insulotropic peptide (gip) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1) consist of tyr-ala and his-ala, respectively, rendering them excellent substrates for dpp4. in addition to its role in modulation of incretin peptides, such as glp-1 and gip, dpp4 regulates immune responses via cleavage of many cytokines and chemokines, including stromal cellderived factor-1 (sdf-1, also known as cxcl12), involved in immune function and physiological functions, such as angiogenesis. in this review, we will focus on the regulatory aspects of dpp4 on chemokines, such as sdf-1, and its potential implications in the pathogenesis and management of cardiovascular disease.dipeptidyl peptidase-4 also called cluster of differentiation-26 (cd26) or adenosine deaminasebinding protein (ada-binding protein), is a member of s9b peptidases. the s9b family consists of structurally homologous proteolytic enzymes, including dpp2 (also called quiescent cell proline dipeptidase, qpp), dpp4, dpp8, dpp9, and fibroblast activation protein (fap). dpp4 was first","Hideki Nakano, Ji Ming Wang, Jixin Zhong, Sanjay Rajagopalan"

5565,Enteropathogen co-infection in UK cats with diarrhoea,"abstractbackground: individual enteropathogen infections in healthy and clinically ill cats are well described, but prevalence and patterns of enteropathogen co-infection have only been reported on a limited basis. we studied enteropathogen co-infection in diarrhoeic uk cats using results of a real time pcr assay for 8 enteropathogenic species; feline coronavirus (co), feline panleukopenia virus (pa), clostridium perfringens (cl), salmonella enterica (sa), giardia spp. (gi), tritrichomonas foetus (tr), cryptosporidium spp. (cr), and toxoplasma gondii (to). age, gender, breed and history were recorded. pcr panels from 1088 diarrhoeic cats were available for analysis.results: overall enteropathogen prevalence was 56.9% (co), 22.1% (pa), 56.6% (cl), 0.8% (sa), 20.6% (gi), 18.8% (tr), 24.4% (cr) and 1.0% (to). prevalence of co, gi and tr was higher in pedigree cats compared to non-pedigree cats (dsh) and prevalence decreased with increasing age for co, pa, gi, cr and tr. co-infection was common: ≥2 enteropathogens were detected in 62.5% of cats, and 13.3% of cats had ≥4 enteropathogens. mean ( x) enteropathogen co-infection 2.01 (±1.3 sd), was significantly higher in pedigree cats ( x =2.51) compared to dsh ( x =1.68) and decreased with age ( x =2.64 <6 months, x =1.68 for >1 yr). more cats were negative for all 8 enteropathogens tested (12.7%) than expected. when exact combinations of co-infection were examined, tr tended to be found in combinations with co, cl, and gi. conclusions: multiple infections should be considered the most likely result of faecal testing in cats, and case management needs to take this into account. in contrast, the relatively high percentage of cats negative for all 8 enteropathogens tested could indicate an innate resistance to infection. alternatively it could indicate a lack of exposure to these 8 enteropathogens or the presence of other enteropathogens not assessed by this assay.","Jasmin K Paris, Sheila Wills, Hans-Jörg Balzer, Darren J Shaw, Danièlle A Gunn-Moore"
9426,Biological Activities of Secretory RNases: Focus on Their Oligomerization to Design Antitumor Drugs,"abstractribonucleases (rnases) are a large number of enzymes gathered into different bacterial or eukaryotic superfamilies. bovine pancreatic rnase a, bovine seminal bs-rnase, human pancreatic rnase 1, angiogenin (rnase 5), and amphibian onconase belong to the pancreatic type superfamily, while binase and barnase are in the bacterial rnase n1/t1 family. in physiological conditions, most rnases secreted in the extracellular space counteract the undesired effects of extracellular rnas and become protective against infections. instead, if they enter the cell, rnases can digest intracellular rnas, becoming cytotoxic and having advantageous effects against malignant cells. their biological activities have been investigated either in vitro, toward a number of different cancer cell lines, or in some cases in vivo to test their potential therapeutic use. however, immunogenicity or other undesired effects have sometimes been associated with their action. nevertheless, the use of rnases in therapy remains an appealing strategy against some still incurable tumors, such as mesothelioma, melanoma, or pancreatic cancer. the rnase inhibitor (ri) present inside almost all cells is the most efficacious sentry to counteract the ribonucleolytic action against intracellular rnas because it forms a tight, irreversible and enzymatically inactive complex with many monomeric rnases. therefore, dimerization or multimerization could represent a useful strategy for rnases to exert a remarkable cytotoxic activity by evading the interaction with ri by steric hindrance. indeed, the majority of the mentioned rnases can hetero-dimerize with antibody derivatives, or even homo-dimerize or multimerize, spontaneously or artificially. this can occur through weak interactions or upon introducing covalent bonds. immuno-rnases, in particular, are fusion proteins representing promising drugs by combining high target specificity with easy delivery in tumors. the results concerning the biological features of many rnases reported in the literature are described and discussed in this review. furthermore, the activities displayed by some rnases forming oligomeric complexes, the mechanisms driving toward these supramolecular structures, and the biological rebounds connected are analyzed. these aspects are offered with the perspective to suggest possible efficacious therapeutic applications for rnases oligomeric derivatives that could contemporarily lack, or strongly reduce, immunogenicity and other undesired side-effects.","Ester Boix, Olga N Ilinskaya, François J M A Meurens, Elio Pizzo, Giovanni Gotte, Marta Menegazzi, Menegazzi Gotte, Rnase Antitumor,  Oligomers"

5500,Insights into the transmission of respiratory infectious diseases through empirical human contact networks OPEN,"abstractin this study, we present representative human contact networks among chinese college students. unlike schools in the us, human contacts within chinese colleges are extremely clustered, partly due to the highly organized lifestyle of chinese college students. simulations of influenza spreading across real contact networks are in good accordance with real influenza records; however, epidemic simulations across idealized scale-free or small-world networks show considerable overestimation of disease prevalence, thus challenging the widely-applied idealized human contact models in epidemiology. furthermore, the special contact pattern within chinese colleges results in disease spreading patterns distinct from those of the us schools. remarkably, class cancelation, though simple, shows a mitigating power equal to quarantine/vaccination applied on ~25% of college students, which quantitatively explains its success in chinese colleges during the sars period. our findings greatly facilitate reliable prediction of epidemic prevalence, and thus should help establishing effective strategies for respiratory infectious diseases control.respiratory infectious diseases pose a serious threat to human health, due to their high mortality rate as well as their rapid transmission across populations 1 . for example, influenza, a highly infectious disease, led to an estimated 250,000~500,000 deaths worldwide each year 2 . in comparison, tuberculosis, although spreading relatively slowly, was reported to cause more than 1.3 million deaths in 2012 3 . however, predicting the prevalence of respiratory infectious diseases and establishing effective control strategies remain fundamental challenges, partly due to the lack of understanding on the principles of disease spread.unraveling the principles of how respiratory infectious diseases spread requires a detailed understanding of human contact networks. briefly, a human contact network consists of nodes representing individuals, as well as edges representing close proximity interactions (cpis) among individuals 4 . respiratory infectious diseases are predominantly transmit via air-borne droplets or aerosol among individuals with close proximity interactions; thus, the topological structure of cpi networks crucially affects transmission of respiratory diseases 5 .due to the lack of real cpi data, idealized models of human contact networks are commonly employed to study epidemic behavior. for instance, one such model, the homogeneous network, assumes any individual to interact with a fixed number of partners 1,5 . this assumption of uniform spread pattern was implicitly adopted by the classical differential-equation approach 6 . another model is the heterogeneous network, such as small-world or scale-free network, which was introduced to capture the fact that in real life, some people are more socially connected than others 7,8 . however, these idealized models were not fully examined on the basis of real cpi data.with the recent development of portable wireless technologies, such as bluetooth, it is now possible to acquire real cpi data in an accurate and direct manner. for instance, two individuals wearing bluetooth-enabled mobile","Chunlin Huang, Xingwu Liu, Shiwei Sun, Shuai Cheng Li, Minghua Deng, Guangxue He, Haicang Zhang, Chao Wang, Yang Zhou, Yanlin Zhao, Dongbo Bu"
5228,Clinical Infectious Diseases Infection Prevention and Control in Asia: Current Evidence and Future Milestones,"abstractthe asia-pacific region is a geographic source for emerging infectious diseases, including multidrug-resistant (mdr) organisms (mdros) and pathogens with pandemic potential. risks for emerging infectious diseases in this geographic region are complex and are presumed to include ecological, socioeconomic, and technological processes favorable to microbial transmission dynamics. in resource-limited settings, relative to resource-adequate settings, there continues to be a paucity of data in support of infection prevention and control, and patient safety interventions to ensure that regional, if not national, healthcare systems work effectively to improve infection prevention and control interventions. in addition, several viral pandemics and annual influenza strains have originated in the asia-pacific region, which, together, has global implications for population health.the prevention, control, and reporting of mdros and healthcare-associated infections (hais) benefit from effective data dissemination plans and harmonized surveillance systems. hais compromise patient safety because they are preventable and serve as a reservoir for mdros, which are associated with excess length of hospital stay, increased antimicrobial drug exposure, and excess costs      . in the asia-pacific region, the risks of hais have been estimated to be 2-20 times higher than in developed countries, with up to 25% of hospitalized patients reported to have acquired infections  . although infection prevention and control is well recognized in the asia-pacific region, there are inconsistencies in the quality of evidence and dedicated resources to enhance current infection prevention practices, surveillance, and patient safety    . existing evidence gaps include education, organizational and cultural barriers, physician and nursing champions, administrative support, infrastructure, fiscal resources, and key leadership that endorse implementation of infection prevention and control as a core component of patient safety programs across the asia-pacific region  7] .this issue of clinical infectious diseases focuses on 3 key themes of infection prevention and control in healthcare settings across the asia-pacific regions: (1) epidemiology and evidence to support prevention and control interventions, (2) enhancements to infection prevention and control in healthcare settings, and (3) practices associated with the containment of emerging infectious diseases and outbreaks. the epidemiological data and evidence to support prevention and control interventions include 2 national survey studies for best practices and 4 epidemiology studies. a survey from thailand and japan relative to the united states compared evidence-based practices for prevention of hais and identified a modifiable gap associated with quality improvement for hospitals in these asian-pacific countries.a second national survey focused on policy, process, and outcomes associated with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and mdr acinetobacter baumannii interventions in thailand. higher compliance (>75%) with bundled approaches was associated with reduction in mrsa, where containment of mdr a. baumannii necessitated bundle compliance along with additional infection control interventions. four other publications describe the complex clinical factors, molecular epidemiology, and transmission dynamic associated with prevalent and emerging mdros in singapore and south korea (eg, mrsa, community-associated mrsa, and carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae). together, these studies provide information on the epidemiology of infection prevention and control and the transmission dynamic of mdros in asia-pacific settings.the second theme in this issue on infection prevention and control in the asia-pacific region is the innovative use of molecular diagnostics, electronically linked administrative data, and information technology to enhance infection prevention and control. findings from 4 meta-analyses or s u p p l e m e n t a r t i c l e","Anucha Apisarnthanarak, Linda M Mundy, Terapong Tantawichien, Amorn Leelarasamee, A Apisarnthanarak"

597,Alphavirus nsP3 ADP-ribosylhydrolase Activity Disrupts Stress Granule Formation,"abstractformation of stress granules (sgs), cytoplasmic condensates of stalled translation initiation complexes, is regulated by post-translational protein modification. alphaviruses interfere with sg formation in response to inhibition of host protein synthesis through the activities of nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). nsp3 has a conserved n-terminal macrodomain that binds and can remove adp-ribose from adpribosylated proteins and a c-terminal hypervariable domain that binds essential sg component g3bp1.we showed that the hydrolase activity of chikungunya virus nsp3 macrodomain removed adpribosylation of g3bp1 and suppressed sg formation. adp-ribosylhydrolase-deficient nsp3 mutants allowed stress-induced cytoplasmic condensation of translation initiation factors. nsp3 also disassembled sg-like aggregates enriched with translation initiation factors that are induced by the expression of fus mutant r495x linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. therefore, our data indicate that regulation of adp-ribosylation controls the localization of translation initiation factors during virus infection and other pathological conditions. all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.non-membranous structures are prevalent in cells and critical for cellular functions, including rna metabolism, embryonic cell fate specification, and neuronal activities    . although the components of these non-membranous structures are often dynamically exchanged with the surrounding milieu, the compositions of these cellular structures remain distinct  . it is, however, unclear how individual components are selectively retained in these non-membranous structures.stress granules (sgs), one of the best characterized dynamic non-membranous structures, are rnaprotein assemblies formed in response to a variety of environmental cues  . in most cases, these environmental cues activate stress-responsive protein kinases that phosphorylate the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eif2α), resulting in the stalling of translation initiation  . the sudden influx of untranslated mrnas is proposed to seed the formation of sgs, where the polynucleotide promotes local concentration of proteins through non-covalent binding  . these rna-binding proteins are highly enriched with low-complexity regions, and emergent data indicate that the nonspecific, weak interactions between these regions are responsible for the condensation of proteins to form higherorder structures, such as microscopically visible sgs    . depending on the type of stress, the composition of sgs could vary , but certain common components, such as ras gtp-activating protein-binding proteins g3bp1/2, are essential for sg formation  11] . dysregulation of sg assembly/disassembly and mutations in the low-complexity region of specific sg proteins are implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as viral infection, cancer and neurodegeneration     . therefore, understanding the regulatory mechanisms of sg assembly is critical for designing novel therapeutics.sg assembly is regulated positively and negatively by post-translational modifications of proteins, including those that conjugate simple chemical groups (such as phosphorylation, o-glcnac glycosylation, methylation, acetylation), attach polypeptides (e.g., neddylation), and add nucleotides as in the case of adp-ribosylation        . adp-ribosylation refers to the addition of one or more adp-all rights reserved. no reuse

poly(adp-ribose) polymerases (parps)    . polymers of adp-ribose i.e., poly(adp-ribose or par], five parps and two isoforms of the degradative enzyme par glycohydrolase (parg) have been identified in sgs, where selective sg proteins are 25, 26] . overexpression of these parps and parg isoforms induces and suppresses sg formation, respectively, while parg knockdown delays sg disassembly  25] . par, like rna, has been proposed to seed formation of non-membranous structures by facilitating the high concentration of low complexity region-containing proteins locally through noncovalent binding to the repetitive monomeric units of the polymer      . the non-covalent par-protein interaction also facilitates the targeting of specific proteins to sgs  26, 29] , such as tdp-43-a key protein involved in several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als). such a targeting mechanism based on par-binding to protein is proposed to regulate tdp-43 localization and prevent the formation of pathological aggregates in als patients  26] .certain parp inhibitors prevent the neurotoxicity in neuronal cells  30] , suggesting that pharmacological modulation of par-mediated protein targeting could have potential therapeutic benefit.sg assembly and disassembly are tightly regulated during infection by many viruses, often reflecting cellular translation status . in the early phase of infection, the presence of doublestranded viral rnas activates protein kinase r (pkr), resulting in eif2α phosphorylation, mrna translation stalling and assembly of sgs enriched with translation factors . yet, many viruses disassemble sgs or suppress sg formation , but the mechanisms and the physiological roles remain largely unclear. for example, the mosquito-borne alphaviruses, which cause a range of diseases from rashes and arthritis to encephalitis, induce sg formation transiently in the early stage of infection, followed by disassembly    . previous studies have identified the alphaviral nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), a key factor for virus replication and virulence    , as able to suppress sg assembly     . nsp3 is a tripartite protein composed of a

11123,Homologous recombination is a force in the evolution of canine distemper virus,"abstractcanine distemper virus (cdv) is the causative agent of canine distemper (cd) that is a highly contagious, lethal, multisystemic viral disease of receptive carnivores. the prevalence of cdv is a major concern in susceptible animals. presently, it is unclear whether intragenic recombination can contribute to gene mutations and segment reassortment in the virus. in this study, 25 full-length cdv genome sequences were subjected to phylogenetic and recombinational analyses. the results of phylogenetic analysis, intragenic recombination, and nucleotide selection pressure indicated that mutation and recombination occurred in the six individual genes segment (h, f, p, n, l, m) of the cdv genome. the analysis also revealed pronounced genetic diversity in the cdv genome according to the geographically distinct lineages (genotypes), namely asia-1, asia-2, asia-3, europe, america-1, and america-2. the six recombination events were detected using simplot and rdp programs. the analysis of selection pressure demonstrated that a majority of the nucleotides in the cdv individual gene were under negative selection. collectively, these data suggested that homologous recombination acts as a key force driving the genetic diversity and evolution of canine distemper virus.","Chaowen Yuan, Wenxin Liu, Yingbo Wang, Jinlong Hou, Liguo Zhang, Guoqing Wang"

5255,Antimicrobial Air Filters Using Natural Euscaphis japonica Nanoparticles,"abstractcontrolling bioaerosols has become more important with increasing participation in indoor activities. treatments using natural-product nanomaterials are a promising technique because of their relatively low toxicity compared to inorganic nanomaterials such as silver nanoparticles or carbon nanotubes. in this study, antimicrobial filters were fabricated from natural euscaphis japonica nanoparticles, which were produced by nebulizing e. japonica extract. the coated filters were assessed in terms of pressure drop, antimicrobial activity, filtration efficiency, major chemical components, and cytotoxicity. pressure drop and antimicrobial activity increased as a function of nanoparticle deposition time (590, 855, and 1150 µg/cm2 filter at 3-, 6-, and 9-min depositions, respectively). in filter tests, the antimicrobial efficacy was greater against staphylococcus epidermidis than micrococcus luteus;~61, 73, and~82% of m. luteus cells were inactivated on filters that had been coated for 3, 6, and 9 min, respectively, while the corresponding values were~78,~88, and~94% with s. epidermidis. although statistically significant differences in filtration performance were not observed between samples as a function of deposition time, the average filtration efficacy was slightly higher for s. epidermidis aerosols (~97%) than for m. luteus aerosols (~95%). high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) and electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (esi/ms) analyses confirmed that the major chemical compounds in the e. japonica extract were 1(ß)-o-galloyl pedunculagin, quercetin-3-o-glucuronide, and kaempferol-3-o-glucoside. in vitro cytotoxicity and disk diffusion tests showed that e. japonica nanoparticles were less toxic and exhibited stronger antimicrobial activity toward some bacterial strains than a reference soluble nickel compound, which is classified as a human carcinogen. this study provides valuable information for the development of a bioaerosol control system that is environmental friendly and suitable for use in indoor environments.","G B Open Access Citation ; Hwang, K J Heo, J H Yun, J E Lee, H J Lee, C W Nho"

5522,HTCC: Broad Range Inhibitor of Coronavirus Entry,"abstractto date, six human coronaviruses have been known, all of which are associated with respiratory infections in humans. with the exception of the highly pathogenic sars and mers coronaviruses, human coronaviruses (hcov-nl63, hcov-oc43, hcov-229e, and hcov-hku1) circulate worldwide and typically cause the common cold. in most cases, infection with these viruses does not lead to severe disease, although acute infections in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients may progress to severe disease requiring hospitalization. importantly, no drugs against human coronaviruses exist, and only supportive therapy is available. previously, we proposed the cationically modified chitosan, n-(2hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride (htcc), and its hydrophobicallymodified derivative (hm-htcc) as potent inhibitors of the coronavirus hcov-nl63. here, we show that htcc inhibits interaction of a virus with its receptor and thus blocks the entry. further, we demonstrate that htcc polymers with different degrees of substitution act as effective inhibitors of all low-pathogenic human coronaviruses.cell culture llc-mk2 cells (atcc: ccl-7; macaca mulatta kidney epithelial) were maintained in minimal essential medium (mem; two parts hanks' mem and one part earle's mem; life technologies, poland) supplemented with 3% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (life technologies, anticoronavirals: htcc plos one |","Aleksandra Milewska, Kamil Kaminski, Justyna Ciejka, Katarzyna Kosowicz, Slawomir Zeglen, Jacek Wojarski, Maria Nowakowska, Krzysztof Szczubiałka, Krzysztof Pyrc"
8677,Progress towards Health for All: Time to End Discrimination and Marginalization,"abstractalthough it has been more than 40 years since ""health for all"" was presented as a focus in the alma ata declaration , the world is still far from achieving this goal. although great progress has been made since then in many areas of health, much of that progress has been confined to rich countries, and even within the richest of countries, health inequality persists. new health problems and threats have arisen in the generations since that hopeful statement, with the scourge of hiv and the challenge of non-communicable diseases (ncds) facing high and low-income countries alike  . with these new challenges, we see inequalities forming along the same old social fault lines and the same axes of deprivation and discrimination. in high-income countries, new risk factors such as obesity and food insecurity cluster in the poorest communities , while on a global level, we see the greatest burden of new diseases such as hiv falling on the poorest countries  , and continuing challenges of health access and financing for the poorest people  . much of this inequality arises from simple economic inequality and the consequences of colonialism, but much also results from the marginalization of certain individuals and groups at community, national and global levels. sexual minorities, people with mental illness, migrants, refugees, the homeless, transient populations, transgender people, sex workers and many other groups who do not conform to existing social norms, or who have historically been marginalized and excluded, experience many often completely preventable illnesses. discrimination against some members of the community, their exclusion from economic, cultural and social processes, and the selective provision of basic services to these communities put them at increased risk of poor health and expose them to preventable risk factors. because the marginalization of these people is socially and historically determined, the health consequences for these people continue to be severe and pernicious, despite being preventable.in this special issue on the health of marginalized people, we have gathered 15 papers from many countries, describing a wide range of physical and mental health issues, using a variety of advanced research methods to understand the health challenges faced by a diverse array of marginalized populations globally, and recommending interventions to improve the health of marginalized populations. first, we summarize the research articles presented in this special issue and then issue a call for renewed action to end discrimination and marginalization in our societies, and to strengthen wider efforts to support the health of the most marginalized people.mental health and suicide are significant issues among marginalized populations which do not receive sufficient attention. in this issue, gilmour et al.  describe the suicide mortality rates of foreigners living in japan compared with those in their country of origin and in japanese nationals. they showed that, distinct from other nationalities, koreans living in japan have substantially higher mortality rates than both japanese people and koreans living in korea, possibly due to the particular int.","Stuart Gilmour, Phuong Le Mai, Phuong Nguyen, Bibha Dhungel, Maki Tomizawa, Huy Nguyen"

7780,Host-Driven Phosphorylation Appears to Regulate the Budding Activity of the Lassa Virus Matrix Protein,"abstractlassa mammarenavirus (lasv) is an enveloped rna virus that can cause lassa fever, an acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome associated with significant morbidity and high rates of fatality in endemic regions of western africa. the arenavirus matrix protein z has several functions during the virus life cycle, including coordinating viral assembly, driving the release of new virus particles, regulating viral polymerase activity, and antagonizing the host antiviral response. there is limited knowledge regarding how the various functions of z are regulated. to investigate possible means of regulation, mass spectrometry was used to identify potential sites of phosphorylation in the lasv z protein. this analysis revealed that two serines (s18, s98) and one tyrosine (y97) are phosphorylated in the flexible n-and c-terminal regions of the protein. notably, two of these sites, y97 and s98, are located in (y97) or directly adjacent to (s98) the ppxy late domain, an important motif for virus release. studies with non-phosphorylatable and phosphomimetic z proteins revealed that these sites are important regulators of the release of lasv particles and that host-driven, reversible phosphorylation may play an important role in the regulation of lasv z protein function.pathogens 2018, 7, 97 2 of 14 2008, outbreaks in sierra leone have resulted in an overall case fatality rate of 69% in hospitalized patients  . lasv infection results in fetal loss in most cases  . further, pregnancy greatly increases the risk of fatality from lassa fever for the mother  . of lassa fever survivors who were hospitalized, approximately one-third developed hearing loss, and in two-thirds of those patients, the hearing deficit was permanent  . intravenous ribavirin treatment has been shown to reduce mortality from lassa fever, particularly if administered during the first six days of fever onset, but there is a clear need for more effective therapies  . no united states food and drug administration (fda)-approved vaccines exist for the prevention of lasv infection.arenaviruses have a simple, negative-strand rna genome that encodes a total of four proteins on two segments. the small (s) segment encodes both the nucleoprotein (np), which encapsidates the viral genome and is required for its replication, and the envelope glycoprotein (gp), which interacts with cell surface receptors to mediate cell entry and membrane fusion       . the large (l) genome segment encodes the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase (l), which replicates and transcribes the genome, and the viral matrix protein (z)     . the z protein is a structural component of the virion, forming a matrix layer on the inner leaflet of the viral envelope, and carries out an array of important functions during viral propagation  24] . the z protein of pathogenic arenaviruses antagonizes interferon production by binding to retinoic acid-inducible gene i (rig-i) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (mda5) to disrupt interactions between rig-i-like receptors and mitochondrial antiviral signaling (mavs)  . z can inhibit the translation of capped cellular mrnas and also regulate the activity of the viral polymerase    . z is also an important coordinator of virus particle assembly by interacting with each of the other three viral proteins  30] .in addition to these functions, the z protein is both necessary and sufficient for driving the efficient release of nascent virus particles  31, 32] . however, minimal levels of virus can be recovered without z  . two major motifs in the z protein mediate the efficient release of virus particles. first, a myristoylation modification of the second residue in z, a glycine, mediates z's interaction with cellular membranes, a requirement for efficient release  35] . second, all arenavirus z proteins, with the exception of the tacaribe virus z protein, contain one or two proline-rich, late domains near the c-terminus  32] . these viral late domains are presumably responsible for recruiting the cellular endosomal sorting complex required for transport (escrt) pathway to mediate membrane scission, which is the final step in the virus budding process  . new world arenavirus z proteins contain a p(s/t)ap-type late domain, which can bind the escrt-i protein tsg101, while the old world z proteins of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (lcmv) and dandenong virus contain only a ppxy late domain, which can bind nedd4-family e3 ubiquitin ligases  24, 32, 37] . additionally, the z proteins of several old world arenaviruses, including lassa, mobala, mopeia, and ippy viruses, encode both the ppxy and the p(s/t)ap late domains  24, 32] . in the case of lasv, decreased virus-like particle (vlp) release occurs following mutation of either of lasv z's ptap and ppxy late domains, disruption of z's recruitment of nedd4-family proteins, and/or loss of specific escrt components  24, 32,    . the release of vlps for the related old world arenavirus lcmv is similarly impacted by ppxy late domain or escrt component disruption  . however, recent work from our lab demonstrated that in a whole virus system, the sole late domain in the lcmv z protein and the escrt pathway it recruits were specifically required for the production of defective interfering particles but not of infectious virus  . this illustrates the complexity and diversity in arenavirus release and highlights the need for a greater understanding of the factors involved in this process.protein phosphorylation is a reversible post-translational modification that can regulate the activity of enzymes, mediate protein-protein interactions, alter the subcellular localization, conformation, and/or oligomeric state of proteins, as well as regulate the addition or removal of other types of post-translation modifications  . this important type of modification is not limited to cellular proteins; a growing body of literature has demonstrated that phosphorylation of viral proteins has important consequences for different viral processes     .","Christopher M Ziegler, Philip Eisenhauer, Inessa Manuelyan, Marion E Weir, Emily A Bruce, Bryan A Ballif, Jason Botten, E A B , B A B "
10499,"REVIEW Intranasal and oral vaccination with protein-based antigens: advantages, challenges and formulation strategies","abstractmost pathogens initiate their infections at the human mucosal surface. therefore, mucosal vaccination, especially through oral or intranasal administration routes, is highly desired for infectious diseases. meanwhile, protein-based antigens provide a safer alternative to the whole pathogen or dna based ones in vaccine development. however, the unique biopharmaceutical hurdles that intranasally or orally delivered protein vaccines need to overcome before they reach the sites of targeting, the relatively low immunogenicity, as well as the low stability of the protein antigens, require thoughtful and fine-tuned mucosal vaccine formulations, including the selection of immunostimulants, the identification of the suitable vaccine delivery system, and the determination of the exact composition and manufacturing conditions. this review aims to provide an up-to-date survey of the protein antigen-based vaccine formulation development, including the usage of immunostimulants and the optimization of vaccine delivery systems for intranasal and oral administrations. keywords mucosal vaccine, protein antigen, adjuvant, immunostimulant, vaccine delivery system electronic supplementary material the online version of this article (subunit protein antigens are much safer alternatives to the whole pathogen or viral vector-based antigens since they have lower risk of causing diseases, but the immunogenicity protein-based mucosal vaccine review","Shujing Wang, Huiqin Liu, Xinyi Zhang, Feng Qian"

10252,cells Nucleolar and Ribosomal DNA Structure under Stress: Yeast Lessons for Aging and Cancer,"abstractonce thought a mere ribosome factory, the nucleolus has been viewed in recent years as an extremely sensitive gauge of diverse cellular stresses. emerging concepts in nucleolar biology include the nucleolar stress response (nsr), whereby a series of cell insults have a special impact on the nucleolus. these insults include, among others, ultra-violet radiation (uv), nutrient deprivation, hypoxia and thermal stress. while these stresses might influence nucleolar biology directly or indirectly, other perturbances whose origin resides in the nucleolar biology also trigger nucleolar and systemic stress responses. among the latter, we find mutations in nucleolar and ribosomal proteins, ribosomal rna (rrna) processing inhibitors and ribosomal dna (rdna) transcription inhibition. the p53 protein also mediates nsr, leading ultimately to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence or differentiation. hence, nsr is gaining importance in cancer biology. the nucleolar size and ribosome biogenesis, and how they connect with the target of rapamycin (tor) signalling pathway, are also becoming important in the biology of aging and cancer. simple model organisms like the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, easy to manipulate genetically, are useful in order to study nucleolar and rdna structure and their relationship with stress. in this review, we summarize the most important findings related to this topic. 2 of 22 ribosome factory, and only recently the myriad of processes that it is involved in have begun to be unraveled    . furthermore, the nucleolar structure has proven as an excellent maker for cell stress and growth status. indeed, nutrition status, environmental cues and stress impinge on its size and shape  8] . the nucleolus is also the assembly site and processing for small nuclear rnas (snrnas), small nucleolar rnas (snornas), telomerase and the signal recognition particle (srp); all of them with physiological implication for the cell that go beyond the nucleolar environment  . to get a much deeper knowledge on the nucleolus in different organisms, we refer the readers to previous excellent reviews by  11] . in this review, we will concentrate on the structural changes of the nucleolus (and the rdna) of the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. however, we will briefly describe some aspects of the nucleolar biology of metazoans that are connected to nucleolar biology of this simple yeast. this correlation has boosted s. cerevisiae as an excellent model organism whereby we can better understand how stress influences the nucleolar biology and vice versa. we will mainly focus on how different stresses modify the morphology of the nucleolus. importantly, we are mostly leaving out of this review the long-term effects that clastogenic and aneugenic stresses can cause on the rdna structure, which can also have a great and sustained impact on the nucleolar morphology. the connections between these stresses, the rdna/nucleolus, cancer and aging deserve by itself a deep and updated review in the future. in summary, we have organized this review in the following chapters. first, a brief historical overview on the nucleolus and its usefulness as a marker of cancer and aging, followed by a description of its composition and structure in the budding yeast. next, we will go over the morphological changes in the nucleolus seen in both a normal unperturbed cell cycle and after stress. we will pay attention to what is known about the underlying mechanisms responsible for nucleolar reorganization and why we now know they intimately connect with aging. finally, we will briefly review a clear case of a connection between nucleolar stress and control of cell proliferation in tumor cells that might be exploited in antitumoral therapy. before we proceed into the next section, we introduce some concepts to better understand the processes presented here. according to roger b. mcdonald's biology of aging, aging is the random change in the structure and function of molecules, cells, and organisms that is caused by the passage of time and by one's interaction with the environment. aging increases the probability of death. on the other hand, longevity is defined as the potential maximum age that an individual of a particular species can attain, that is, the evolved length or duration of life for a species; while life span is the length of life of an individual cell, organ or organism  . in budding yeast, aging has been traditionally divided into two different concepts. the first concept, replicative aging, stems from early works in the 50s, and is defined as the number of divisions an individual yeast cell undergoes before dying. the second concept, chronological aging, is the length of time a population of yeast cells remains viable in a nondividing state following nutrient deprivation  14] . both terms are also usually referred as replicative life span and chronological life span based on the assays developed to measure them  . on the next section, we will explain very briefly the evidences for the nucleolar size in relation to cancer and aging.the size and shape of the nucleolus are tightly related to the growth and proliferation status of the eukaryotic cell, and this is known since several decades ago  17] . an increase in size correlates with a high growth and proliferation rate  , and this feature has been used by pathologists over decades as a prognostic marker in tumour tissue samples  . in fact, for a specific type of cancer, the clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccrcc), the nucleolus is used as the main marker to establish the histological grade  21] . tumour samples with a normal nucleolar number, size and shape correlates with a good prognostic, while an enlarged size and/or irregular shape correlates with a bad prognostic    . ribosome biogenesis is thus becoming an important aspect of cancer biology . remarkably, nucleolar size and aging are also correlated; small nucleoli and reduced ribosome biogenesis are hallmarks of longevity, whereas expanded nucleoli, elevated ribosome biogenesis and increased protein synthesis are hallmarks of aging . on the one hand, long-lived mutants of caenorhabditis elegans cells 2019, 8, 779 3 of 22(e.g., daf-2), drosophila melanogaster (under dietary restriction, rapamycin treatment or insulin-like mutants), mice (under dietary restriction and irs1 long-lived mutants) and human muscles biopsies (under modest dietary restriction) showed the small nucleoli phenotype . on the other hand, cells from hutchinson-gilford progeria syndrome (hgps) patients and cells from aged healthy individuals showed the expanded nucleoli phenotype . in yeast, nucleolar structure goes through two different phases during aging as well: first, expansion and, secondary to this, fragmentation . the above observations, conserved throughout evolution, could be employed as a predictive cellular marker for aging in both healthy and aged individuals .","Emiliano Matos-Perdomo, Félix Machín"
10872,Open Peer Review Human rhinovirus spatial-temporal epidemiology in rural observed through outpatient surveillance [version 2; peer review: 2 approved],"abstracthuman rhinovirus (hrv) is the predominant cause of upper background: respiratory tract infections, resulting in a significant public health burden. the virus circulates as many different types (168), each generating strong homologous, but weak heterotypic, immunity. the influence of these features on transmission patterns of hrv in the community is understudied. nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients with symptoms methods: of acute respiratory infection (ari) at nine out-patient facilities across a health and demographic surveillance system between december 2015 and november 2016. hrv was diagnosed by real-time rt-pcr, and the vp4/vp2 genomic region of the positive samples sequenced. phylogenetic analysis was used to determine the hrv types. classification models and g-test statistic were used to investigate hrv type spatial distribution. demographic characteristics and clinical features of ari were also compared.of 5,744 nps samples collected, hrv was detected in 1057 (18.4%), results: of which 817 (77.3%) were successfully sequenced. hrv species a, b and c were identified in 360 (44.1%), 67 (8.2%) and 390 (47.7%) samples, respectively. in total, 87 types were determined: 39, 10 and 38 occurred within species a, b and c, respectively. hrv types presented heterogeneous temporal patterns of persistence. spatially, identical types occurred over a wide distance at similar times, but there was statistically significant evidence for clustering of types between health facilities in close proximity or linked by major road networks.this study records a high prevalence of hrv in out-patient conclusion: presentations exhibiting high type diversity. patterns of occurrence suggest frequent and independent community invasion of different types. temporal differences of persistence between types may reflect variation in type-specific population immunity. spatial patterns suggest either rapid spread or multiple invasions of the same type, but evidence of similar types amongst close health facilities, or along road systems, indicate type partitioning structured by local spread.pubmed abstract | publisher full textaponte fe, taboada b, espinoza ma, et al.: rhinovirus is an important pathogen in upper and lower respiratory tract infections in mexican children. virol j. 2015; 12(1): 31. pubmed abstract | publisher full text | free full text 3. richter j, panayiotou c, tryfonos c, et al.: aetiology of acute respiratory tract infections in hospitalised children in cyprus. plos one. 2016; 11(1): e0147041. pubmed abstract | publisher full text | free full text 4. nguyen dnt, mai lq, bryant je, et al.: epidemiology and etiology of influenzalike-illness in households in vietnam; it's not all about the kids!

8904,Using mutagenesis to explore conserved residues in the RNA- binding groove of influenza A virus nucleoprotein for antiviral drug development OPEN,"abstractinfluenza np is a valid target for antiviral drug development. the surface of the groove, covered with numerous conserved residues between the head and body domains of influenza a np, plays a crucial role in rna binding. to explore the mechanism by which np binds rna, we performed a series of sitedirected mutagenesis in the rna-binding groove, followed by surface plasmon resonance (spr), to characterize the interactions between rna and np. furthermore, a role of y148 in np stability and np-rna binding was evaluated. the aromatic residue of y148 was found to stack with a nucleotide base. by interrupting the stacking interaction between y148 and an rna base, we identified an influenza virus np inhibitor, (e, e)-1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) -1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione; this inhibitor reduced the np's rna-binding affinity and hindered viral replication. our findings will be useful for the development of new drugs that disrupt the interaction between rna and viral np in the influenza virus.influenza is an infectious disease of birds and mammals caused by the influenza viruses belonging to the family orthomyxoviridae 1 . the sudden swine-origin influenza virus h1n1v pandemic outbreak in 2009 caused 18,000 deaths 1,2 . the viral surface proteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase have played important roles in antiviral drug discoveries and provide crucial neutralization against the virus 3 . tamiflu (oseltamivir), which is a neuraminidase inhibitor, is used to treat flu infection 4-7 . however, several h1n1 influenza strains are resistant to tamiflu because they contain the h274y mutation in neuraminidase. thus, new anti-influenza drugs are urgently needed.influenza a virus nucleoprotein (np) is a major virion structural protein that has been predicted to interact with negative-strand viral rna during viral nucleocapsid formation 8 . np encapsulates the viral genome for rna transcription, replication, virus packaging, and intracellular trafficking, and it also functions as a key adapter molecule between viral and host cell processes 9 . np has been shown to cooperatively interact with rna. in addition, np interacts with a wide variety of viral and cellular macromolecules, including two subunits of the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase, viral matrix, actin, components of the nuclear import/export apparatus, and a nuclear rna helicase 10 . according to protein sequence alignment, the 498-aa np is highly conserved among influenza viruses. the multifunctional capabilities of np in the viral life cycle makes this protein an attractive target for drug development 11,12 .a substantial quantity of rna is wrapped around each np monomer, with a stoichiometric ratio of 20 nucleotides of rna per 1 np 13 . the np crystal structure reveals that rna molecules likely bind to a deep groove located between the head and body domains on the exterior of the np oligomer 14, 15 . several residues that are critical for rna binding and virus infectivity in the influenza a virus np have been identified 16, 17 . ye et al. have been reported that the tail loop binding pocket as a potential target for antiviral development 14 . le et al. reported that several np mutations that affected the efficient incorporation of multiple viral-rna (vrna) segments into progeny virions even though a single vrna segment was incorporated efficiently 16 . however, understanding structural and mechanistic information regarding influenza a virus np and its interactions with rna should facilitate the discovery of agents that specifically block the formation of ribonucleoprotein (rnp) during viral genome replication.accordingly, we proposed that the surface of the groove, which contains numerous conserved residues (including y148, r150, r152, r156, r174, r175, k184, r195, r199, r213, r214, r221, r236) is able to interact with the rna residue (fig. 1) . in this study, we performed a series of site-directed mutagenesis to explore the mechanism by which the np binds rna, followed by surface plasmon resonance (spr) to monitor the binding between various mutants and rna. furthermore, a role of y148 in the protein stability of np and the binding of np to rna was evaluated. an aromatic residue, y148 was also found to stack its benzene ring with a nucleotide base. by targeting y148, we identified an influenza virus np inhibitor, h7 (e,e) -1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-me thoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione], which reduced the np's rna-binding affinity and hindered viral replication. finally, we present a structural model of the influenza np in complex with rna, which clearly illustrates the critical role of y148.","Chia-Lin Liu, Hui-Chen Hung, Shou-Chen Lo, Ching-Hui Chiang, I-Jung Chen, John T , -A Hsu, Ming-Hon Hou"

5104,Vesicular stomatitis Virus-Based Vaccine protects Mice against Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever,"abstracthemorrhagic syndrome in humans but not in its animal host. the virus is widely distributed throughout southeastern europe, the middle east, africa, and asia. disease management has proven difficult and there are no broadly licensed vaccines or therapeutics. recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rvsv) expressing foreign glycoproteins (gp) have shown promise as experimental vaccines for several viral hemorrhagic fevers. here, we developed and assessed a replication competent rvsv vector expressing the cchfv glycoprotein precursor (gpc), which encodes cchfv structural glycoproteins. this construct drives strong expression of cchfv-gp, in vitro. using these vectors, we vaccinated stat-1 knock-out mice, an animal model for cchfv. the vector was tolerated and 100% efficacious against challenge from a clinical strain of cchfv. anti-cchfv-gp igg and neutralizing antibody titers were observed in surviving animals. this study demonstrates that a rvsv expressing only the cchfv-gp has the potential to serve as a replication competent vaccine platform against cchf infections.currently, there are several experimental vaccine candidates that have relied on the gpc as an antigenic component, which have been evaluated in immunocompromised signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 knock-out (stat-1 −/− ), interferon α/β receptor knock-out (ifnar), or interferon receptor antibody transiently suppressed (is) mouse models for cchfv, as they recapitulate clinical illness and are uniformly lethal models for cchf      . vaccine candidate approaches have focused on either dna expression of cchfv antigens in host tissues, replication deficient viral-like particles, inactivated whole virus preparations, subunit antigen preparations, or vectored vaccinia virus vaccines 16,       . two of these preparations, a prime and boost strategy using modified recombinant vaccinia virus (strain: ankara) mva] encoding the gpc, and a prime, boost, and boost strategy with a dna based vaccine encoding separate np, g n , and g c antigens, have provided promising results with up to 100% protection in the ifnar mouse model for cchfv 23, 25 . although cchfv-np by itself as an antigen in the mva vaccine platform has failed to provide protection 26 .recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rvsv) have been developed and evaluated as promising experimental vaccines for several pathogens, often requiring only a single-dose to induce protection 27-31 . the rvsv platform has been experimentally evaluated for both durability and safety 32-34 , and two rvsv vaccines, one for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) 35 and a second for zaire ebolavirus (ebov), have been tested in human clinical trials    . for these reasons, we hypothesized that rvsv vectors expressing cchfv-gpc could elicit a protective response in a lethal animal model for cchf. the aim of our study was to design, generate, characterize, and evaluate a rvsv vector encoding the cchfv-gpc as an experimental vaccine for cchfv.","Sergio E Rodriguez, Robert W Cross, Karla A Fenton, Dennis A Bente, Chad E Mire, Thomas W Geisbert"
5826,Risk Factors for Infectious Diseases in Backyard Poultry Farms in the Poyang Lake Area,"abstractemergence and transmission of infectious diseases have an enormous impact on the poultry industry and present a serious threat to the health of humans and wild birds. noncommercial poultry operations, such as backyard poultry facilities in china, are potential sources of virus exchange between commercial poultry and wild birds. it is particularly critical in wetland areas where backyard poultry have close contact with commercial poultry and migratory birds, therefore increasing the risk of contracting infectious diseases. to evaluate the transmission risks, a cross-sectional study was undertaken in the poyang lake area, china, involving 309 residents in the backyard poultry farms in three counties (region a, b, and c) of jiangxi province. we examined the backyard poultry population, poultry species, presence of poultry deaths from infectious diseases, food sources, and biosecurity practices. region b ranked highest for biosecurity while region c ranked lowest. the risks of infectious diseases were assessed by adjusted odds ratio based on multivariate logistic regression analysis. potential risk factors in the three regions of the study site were compared. in region a, significant factor was contact of poultry with wild birds (or: 6.573, 95% ci: 2.148-20.115, p=0.001). in region b, the most significant factor was contact of poultry with neighboring backyard waterfowls (or: 3.967, 95% ci: 1.555-10.122, p=0.004). in region c, significant factors were poultry purchase from local live bird markets (or: 3.740, 95% ci: 1.243-11.255, p=0.019), and contact of poultry with wild birds (or: 3.379, 95% ci: 1.058-10.791, p=0.040). in summary, backyard poultry was significantly affected by neighboring commercial poultry and close contact with wild birds. the results are expected to improve our understanding of the transmission risks of infectious diseases in a typical backyard poultry environment in rural china, and address the need to improve local farming practices and take preventive measures.","Y Wang, Z Jiang, Jin Z Tan, H Xu, B "
7442,A Preliminary Study of Viral Metagenomics of French Bat Species in Contact with Humans: Identification of New Mammalian Viruses,"abstractthe prediction of viral zoonosis epidemics has become a major public health issue. a profound understanding of the viral population in key animal species acting as reservoirs represents an important step towards this goal. bats harbor diverse viruses, some of which are of particular interest because they cause severe human diseases. however, little is known about the diversity of the global population of viruses found in bats (virome). we determined the viral diversity of five different french insectivorous bat species (nine specimens in total) in close contact with humans. sequence-independent amplification, high-throughput sequencing with illumina technology and a dedicated bioinformatics analysis pipeline were used on pooled tissues (brain, liver and lungs). comparisons of the sequences of contigs and unassembled reads provided a global taxonomic distribution of virus-related sequences for each sample, highlighting differences both within and between bat species. many viral families were present in these viromes, including viruses known to infect bacteria, plants/fungi, insects or vertebrates, the most relevant being those infecting mammals (retroviridae, herpesviridae, bunyaviridae, poxviridae, flaviviridae, reoviridae, bornaviridae, picobirnaviridae). in particular, we detected several new mammalian viruses, including rotaviruses, gammaretroviruses, bornaviruses and bunyaviruses with the identification of the first bat nairovirus. these observations demonstrate that bats naturally harbor viruses from many different families, most of which infect mammals. they may therefore constitute a major reservoir of viral diversity that should be analyzed carefully, to determine the role played by bats in the spread of zoonotic viral infections.","Laurent Dacheux, Minerva Cervantes-Gonzalez, Ghislaine Guigon, Jean-Michel Thiberge, Mathias Vandenbogaert, Corinne Maufrais, Valé Rie Caro, Hervé Bourhy, Herman Tse"
6166,Discovery of antitumor lectins from rainforest tree root transcriptomes,"abstractglycans are multi-branched sugars that are displayed from lipids and proteins. through their diverse polysaccharide structures they can potentiate a myriad of cellular signaling pathways involved in development, growth, immuno-communication and survival. not surprisingly, disruption of glycan synthesis is fundamental to various human diseases; including cancer, where aberrant glycosylation drives malignancy. here, we report the discovery of a novel mannose-binding lectin, ml6, which selectively recognizes and binds to these irregular tumor-specific glycans to elicit potent and rapid cancer cell death. this lectin was engineered from gene models identified in a tropical rainforest tree root transcriptome and is unusual in its six canonical mannose binding domains (qxdxnxvxy), each with a unique amino acid sequence. remarkably, ml6 displays antitumor activity that is >10 5 times more potent than standard chemotherapeutics, while being almost completely inactive towards non-transformed, healthy cells. this activity, in combination with results from glycan binding studies, suggests ml6 differentiates healthy and malignant cells by exploiting divergent glycosylation pathways that yield naïve and incomplete cell surface glycans in tumors. thus, ml6 and other high-valence lectins may serve as novel biochemical tools to elucidate the glycomic signature of different human tumors and aid in the rational design of carbohydratedirected therapies. further, understanding how nature evolves proteins, like ml6, to combat the changing defenses of competing microorganisms may allow for fundamental advances in the way we approach combinatorial therapies to fight therapeutic resistance in cancer. open access citation: lawanprasert a, guinan ca, langford ea, hawkins ce, sloand jn, fescemyer hw, et al.

6665,Transmission of Influenza A in a Student Office Based on Realistic Person-to-Person Contact and Surface Touch Behaviour,"abstractinfluenza a viruses result in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of individuals worldwide each year. in this study, influenza a transmission in a graduate student office is simulated via long-range airborne, fomite, and close contact routes based on real data from more than 3500 person-to-person contacts and 127,000 surface touches obtained by video-camera. the long-range airborne, fomite and close contact routes contribute to 54.3%, 4.2% and 44.5% of influenza a infections, respectively. for the fomite route, 59.8%, 38.1% and 2.1% of viruses are transmitted to the hands of students from private surfaces around the infected students, the students themselves and other susceptible students, respectively. the intranasal dose via fomites of the students' bodies, belongings, computers, desks, chairs and public facilities are 8.0%, 6.8%, 13.2%, 57.8%, 9.3% and 4.9%, respectively. the intranasal dose does not monotonously increase or decrease with the virus transfer rate between hands and surfaces. mask wearing is much more useful than hand washing for control of influenza a in the tested office setting. regular cleaning of high-touch surfaces, which can reduce the infection risk by 2.14%, is recommended and is much more efficient than hand-washing. via airplane and other modes of public transport  . microscopic factors such as how people talk or make contact with each other are ignored because of complexity. most human behaviour, including person-to-person contact and surface touches, are hypothesised even when all transmission routes are considered. however, human behaviour changes with the environment, and large errors may result if all human behaviour is unknown or randomly set. a simulation of influenza a transmission based on realistic data of human behaviour in a confined space is needed to help understand influenza a transmission and to implement effective measures to prevent and control disease.in this study, we simulated influenza a transmission in a graduate student office by considering three routes: long-range airborne, fomite and close contact (short-range airborne and droplet spray). all student behaviour, including close contact and surface touches in the office, was recorded by video-camera from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., from 11 to 15 september 2017. the data included more than 3500 close contacts between students and more than 127,000 surface touches. influenza a transmission was simulated in the office via three routes based on realistic behaviour obtained from these recorded data. we discovered how influenza a virus is transmitted via air, hands, surfaces, mucous membranes and inhalation. we also analysed the efficacy of various strategies for prevention of influenza a via various transmission routes.","Nan Zhang, Yuguo Li"
8942,viruses Viruses and Autoimmunity: A Review on the Potential Interaction and Molecular Mechanisms,"abstractfor a long time, viruses have been shown to modify the clinical picture of several autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (t1d), systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), rheumatoid arthritis (ra), sjögren's syndrome (ss), herpetic stromal keratitis (hsk), celiac disease (cd), and multiple sclerosis (ms). best examples of viral infections that have been proposed to modulate the induction and development of autoimmune diseases are the infections with enteric viruses such as coxsackie b virus (cvb) and rotavirus, as well as influenza a viruses (iav), and herpesviruses. other viruses that have been studied in this context include, measles, mumps, and rubella. epidemiological studies in humans and experimental studies in animal have shown that viral infections can induce or protect from autoimmunopathologies depending on several factors including genetic background, host-elicited immune responses, type of virus strain, viral load, and the onset time of infection. still, data delineating the clear mechanistic interaction between the virus and the immune system to induce autoreactivity are scarce. available data indicate that viral-induced autoimmunity can be activated through multiple mechanisms including molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, bystander activation, and immortalization of infected b cells. contrarily, the protective effects can be achieved via regulatory immune responses which lead to the suppression of autoimmune phenomena. therefore, a better understanding of the immune-related molecular processes in virus-induced autoimmunity is warranted. here we provide an overview of the current understanding of viral-induced autoimmunity and the mechanisms that are associated with this phenomenon. viruses 2019, 11, 762 2 of 18, and several others  . another hypothesized mechanism is the ""bystander activation"", whereby a non-specific and an over-reactive antiviral immune response creates a localized pro-inflammatory environment along with the release of self-antigens from the damaged tissue. these self-antigens are subsequently taken up and presented by antigen presenting cells (apc) to stimulate the previously non-responsive, yet autoreactive t cells in the vicinity triggering autoimmunity  . a related mechanism is called ""epitope spreading"", in which a viral infection triggers the release of more self-antigens and the de novo activation of autoreactive cells, which consequently spread to target additional self-epitopes  . both molecular mimicry and bystander activation have been observed in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae) model of multiple sclerosis (ms) , west nile virus (wnv)-mediated myasthenia gravis (mg)  , tmev-idd  , and other disorders  . moreover, viruses may immortalize autoreactive effector cells as observed in epstein-barr virus (ebv)-infected b cells  . while several hypotheses have been proposed to understand the mechanisms underlying virus-induced autoimmunity, the precise contribution of these mechanisms are not yet fully understood. this review summarizes the recent findings on virally induced autoimmunity and the potential underlying mechanisms triggering the development of this disorder.","Maria K Smatti, Farhan S Cyprian, Gheyath K Nasrallah, Asmaa A Al Thani, Ruba O Almishal, Hadi M Yassine"

3925,"viruses Ebola Virus Maintenance: If Not (Only) Bats, What Else?","abstractthe maintenance mechanisms of ebolaviruses in african forest ecosystems are still unknown, but indirect evidences point at the involvement of some bat species. despite intense research, the main bat-maintenance hypothesis has not been confirmed yet. the alternative hypotheses of a non-bat maintenance host or a maintenance community including, or not, several bat and other species, deserves more investigation. however, african forest ecosystems host a large biodiversity and abound in potential maintenance hosts. how does one puzzle out? since recent studies have revealed that several bat species have been exposed to ebolaviruses, the common denominator to these hypotheses is that within the epidemiological cycle, some bats species must be exposed to the viruses and infected by these potential alternative hosts. under this constraint, and given the peculiar ecology of bats (roosting behaviour, habitat utilisation, and flight mode), we review the hosts and transmission pathways that can lead to bat exposure and infection to ebolaviruses. in contrast to the capacity of bats to transmit ebolaviruses and other pathogens to many hosts, our results indicate that only a limited number of hosts and pathways can lead to the transmission of ebolaviruses to bats, and that the alternative maintenance host, if it exists, must be amongst them. a list of these pathways is provided, along with protocols to prioritise and investigate these alternative hypotheses. in conclusion, taking into account the ecology of bats and their known involvement in ebolaviruses ecology drastically reduces the list of potential alternative maintenance hosts for ebolaviruses. understanding the natural history of ebolaviruses is a health priority, and investigating these alternative hypotheses could complete the current effort focused on the role of bats.ebvs are zoonotic pathogens. several ebv species in africa have spilled over into human populations several times from animals to humans, with primary cases (confirmed or suspected) occurring close or within forest habitats and often after close contacts (e.g., hunting, transport, eating) between humans and forest wild species (including duikers, monkeys, and great apes)            . the disease ecology of ebv is, therefore, multi-hosts and deeply entrenched at human/wildlife interfaces within forest ecosystems. there is a need to understand what constitutes the maintenance of ebv (that could differ from one ebv species to another), namely, a maintenance host or a maintenance community, i.e., several species in interaction within specific forest ecosystems. understanding how this maintenance system works could help in predicting and preventing future outbreaks. here, we briefly present current and discuss alternative hypotheses in order to provide insight into different avenues of investigation. we will focus on the disease ecology of the zaire ebolavirus (ebov) for simplicity, but most of the following hypotheses apply to the other african ebvs.","Alexandre Caron, Mathieu Bourgarel, Julien Cappelle, Florian Liégeois, Hélène M De Nys, François Roger"
5867,viruses Can Bats Serve as Reservoirs for Arboviruses?,"abstractbats are known to harbor and transmit many emerging and re-emerging viruses, many of which are extremely pathogenic in humans but do not cause overt pathology in their bat reservoir hosts: henipaviruses (nipah and hendra), filoviruses (ebola and marburg), and coronaviruses (sars-cov and mers-cov). direct transmission cycles are often implicated in these outbreaks, with virus shed in bat feces, urine, and saliva. an additional mode of virus transmission between bats and humans requiring further exploration is the spread of disease via arthropod vectors. despite the shared ecological niches that bats fill with many hematophagous arthropods (e.g., mosquitoes, ticks, biting midges, etc.) known to play a role in the transmission of medically important arboviruses, knowledge surrounding the potential for bats to act as reservoirs for arboviruses is limited. to this end, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken examining the current understanding and potential for bats to act as reservoirs for viruses transmitted by blood-feeding arthropods.serosurveillance and viral isolation from either free-ranging or captive bats are described in relation to four arboviral groups (bunyavirales, flaviviridae, reoviridae, togaviridae). further, ecological associations between bats and hematophagous viral vectors are characterized (e.g., bat bloodmeals in mosquitoes, ingestion of mosquitoes by bats, etc). lastly, knowledge gaps related to hematophagous ectoparasites (bat bugs and bed bugs (cimicidae) and bat flies (nycteribiidae and streblidae)), in addition to future directions for characterization of bat-vector-virus relationships are described.","Anna C Fagre, Rebekah C Kading"

4871,Quantitative and Chemical Fingerprint Analysis for the Quality Evaluation of Isatis indigotica based on Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography with Photodiode Array Detector Combined with Chemometric Methods,"abstracta simple and reliable method of ultra-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detector (uplc-pda) was developed to control the quality of radix isatidis (dried root of isatis indigotica) for chemical fingerprint analysis and quantitative analysis of eight bioactive constituents, including r,s-goitrin, progoitrin, epiprogoitrin, gluconapin, adenosine, uridine, guanosine, and hypoxanthine. in quantitative analysis, the eight components showed good regression (r > 0.9997) within test ranges, and the recovery method ranged from 99.5% to 103.0%. the uplc fingerprints of the radix isatidis samples were compared by performing chemometric procedures, including similarity analysis, hierarchical clustering analysis, and principal component analysis. the chemometric procedures classified radix isatidis and its finished products such that all samples could be successfully grouped according to crude herbs, prepared slices, and adulterant baphicacanthis cusiae rhizoma et radix. the combination of quantitative and chromatographic fingerprint analysis can be used for the quality assessment of radix isatidis and its finished products.int. j. mol. sci. 2012, 13 9036","Yan-Hong Shi, Zhi-Yong Xie, Rui Wang, Shan-Jun Huang, Yi-Ming Li, Zheng-Tao Wang"
9405,GenomeFingerprinter: The Genome Fingerprint and the Universal Genome Fingerprint Analysis for Systematic Comparative Genomics,"abstractbackground: no attention has been paid on comparing a set of genome sequences crossing genetic components and biological categories with far divergence over large size range. we define it as the systematic comparative genomics and aim to develop the methodology.results: first, we create a method, genomefingerprinter, to unambiguously produce a set of three-dimensional coordinates from a sequence, followed by one three-dimensional plot and six two-dimensional trajectory projections, to illustrate the genome fingerprint of a given genome sequence. second, we develop a set of concepts and tools, and thereby establish a method called the universal genome fingerprint analysis (ugfa). particularly, we define the total genetic component configuration (tgcc) (including chromosome, plasmid, and phage) for describing a strain as a systematic unit, the universal genome fingerprint map (ugfm) of tgcc for differentiating strains as a universal system, and the systematic comparative genomics (scg) for comparing a set of genomes crossing genetic components and biological categories. third, we construct a method of quantitative analysis to compare two genomes by using the outcome dataset of genome fingerprint analysis. specifically, we define the geometric center and its geometric mean for a given genome fingerprint map, followed by the euclidean distance, the differentiate rate, and the weighted differentiate rate to quantitatively describe the difference between two genomes of comparison. moreover, we demonstrate the applications through case studies on various genome sequences, giving tremendous insights into the critical issues in microbial genomics and taxonomy.we have created a method, genomefingerprinter, for rapidly computing, geometrically visualizing, intuitively comparing a set of genomes at genome fingerprint level, and hence established a method called the universal genome fingerprint analysis, as well as developed a method of quantitative analysis of the outcome dataset. these have set up the methodology of systematic comparative genomics based on the genome fingerprint analysis.","Yuncan Ai, Hannan Ai, Fanmei Meng, Lei Zhao"
5705,Therapeutic applications of nucleic acid aptamers in microbial infections,"abstracttoday, the treatment of bacterial infections is a major challenge, due to growing rate of multidrug-resistant bacteria, complication of treatment and increased healthcare costs. moreover, new treatments for bacterial infections are limited. oligonucleotide aptamers are single stranded dnas or rnas with target-selective high-affinity feature, which considered as nucleic acid-based affinity ligands, replacing monoclonal antibodies. the aptamerbased systems have been found to be talented tools in the treatment of microbial infections, regarding their promising anti-biofilm and antimicrobial activities; they can reduce or inhibit the effects of bacterial toxins, and inhibit pathogen invasion to immune cell, as well as they can be used in drug delivery systems. the focus of this review is on the therapeutic applications of aptamers in infections. in this regard, an introduction of infections and related challenges were presented, first. then, aptamer definition and selection, with a brief history of aptamers development against various pathogens and toxins were reviewed. diverse strategies of aptamer application in drug delivery, as well as, the effect of aptamers on the immune system, as the main natural agents of human defense against pathogens, were also discussed. finally, the future trends in clinical applications of this technology were discussed.","Shima Afrasiabi, Maryam Pourhajibagher, Reza Raoofian, Maryam Tabarzad, Abbas Bahador"
4984,Port d'Entrée for Respiratory Infections -Does the Influenza A Virus Pave the Way for Bacteria?,"abstractbacterial and viral co-infections of the respiratory tract are life-threatening and present a global burden to the global community. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes are frequent colonizers of the upper respiratory tract. imbalances through acquisition of seasonal viruses, e.g., influenza a virus, can lead to bacterial dissemination to the lower respiratory tract, which in turn can result in severe pneumonia. in this review, we summarize the current knowledge about bacterial and viral co-infections of the respiratory tract and focus on potential experimental models suitable for mimicking this disease. transmission of iav and pneumonia is mainly modeled by mouse infection. few studies utilizing ferrets, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and non-human primates are also available. the knowledge gained from these studies led to important discoveries and advances in understanding these infectious diseases. nevertheless, mouse and other infection models have limitations, especially in translation of the discoveries to humans. here, we suggest the use of human engineered lung tissue, human ex vivo lung tissue, and porcine models to study respiratory co-infections, which might contribute to a greater translation of the results to humans and improve both, animal and human health.","Mattias Collin, Michael S Chaussee, Nikolai Siemens, Sonja Oehmcke-Hecht, Thomas C Mettenleiter, Bernd Kreikemeyer, Peter Valentin-Weigand, Sven Hammerschmidt"
9790,An Economic Analysis of the Costs Associated with Pre-Weaning Management Strategies for Dairy Heifers,"abstractsimple summary: rearing of replacement female calves on a dairy farm is of critical importance to maintain herd sizes, improve the genetic quality of the herd, and remain economically sustainable. a 2-year investment period is needed for replacement female heifers to grow before entering the milking herd. the management of replacements over this 2-year period can vary greatly among operations, making it difficult to compare producers' cost to benchmark. the objective of this project was to develop a model to calculate the cost of rearing a replacement heifer from birth to weaning under different housing, milk source, allotments, and labor and health management decisions to be used as a dairy farm decision support tool. we calculated the cost for management options with general cost values. we found that the average feed cost represented 46% of the total cost while labor, and fixed and variable costs represented 33%, 9%, and 12%, respectively. the total cost increased as milk allotment increased, but cost per kg of gain decreased. the ranges in total cost within each management scenario often exceed the difference in cost from one scenario to the next. in conclusion, variable costs have the potential to vary among operations, playing a major role in the total cost of rearing replacements from birth to weaning.abstract: dairy calves are raised in various housing and feeding environments on dairy farms around north america. the objective of this study was to develop a simulation model to calculate the cost of raising replacement dairy heifers using different inputs that reflect different management decisions and evaluate their influence on the total cost. in this simulation, 84 calves were modeled between 0-2 months of age to reflect a 1000 heifer herd. the decisions associated with housing, liquid diet source and allowance, labor utilization, and health were calculated. costs and biological responses were reflective of published surveys, literature, and market conditions. a 10,000-iteration economic simulation was used for each management scenario using @risk and precisiontree add-ons (palisade corporation, ithaca, ny, usa) to account for variation in pre-weaning mortality rate, weaning age, and disease prevalence. as milk allotment increased, total feed cost increased. feeding calves a higher allowance of milk resulted in a lower cost per kg of gain. average feed cost percentage of the total cost was 46% (min, max: 33%, 59%) while labor, and fixed and variable cost represented 33% (20%, 45%), 9% (2%, 12%), and 12% (10%, 14%), respectively. total pre-weaning costs ranged from $258.56 to $582.98 per calf across all management scenarios and milk allotments. project administration, j.h.c.c.the authors would like to thank dannon for their continued support of this project.","Anna Hawkins, Kenneth Burdine, Donna Amaral-Phillips, Joao H C Costa"
532,Gut microbiota structure differs between honey,"abstractadult honey bees harbor a specialized gut microbiota of relatively low complexity. while 25 seasonal differences in community composition have been reported, previous studies have 26 focused on compositional changes rather than differences in absolute bacterial loads. 27 moreover, little is known about the gut microbiota of winter bees, which live much longer 28 than bees during the foraging season, and which are critical for colony survival. we 29 quantified seven core members of the bee gut microbiota in a single colony over two years 30 and characterized the community composition in 14 colonies during summer and winter.our data shows that total bacterial loads substantially differ between foragers, nurses, and 32 winter bees. long-lived winter bees had the highest bacterial loads and the lowest 33 community α-diversity, with a characteristic shift towards high levels of bartonella and 34 commensalibacter, and a reduction of opportunistic colonizers. using gnotobiotic bee 35 experiments, we show that diet is a major contributor to the observed differences in 36 bacterial loads. overall, our study reveals that the gut microbiota of winter bees is 37 remarkably different from foragers and nurses. considering the importance of winter bees 38 for colony survival, future work should focus on the role of the gut microbiota in winter 39 bee health and disease. 40 41 . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license author/funder. it is made available under a the copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the .  doi: biorxiv preprint 42 the european honey bee, apis mellifera, is an important pollinator species for natural 43 ecosystems and agricultural production . its health status is threatened by numerous 44 factors including habitat loss, pesticide exposure, and high parasite and pathogen loads -45 4]. accumulating evidence suggests that the gut microbiota of adult honey bees plays a 46 critical role for bee health . the bee microbiota converts dietary compounds  7] and 47 produces short chain fatty acids  in the gut, enhances sucrose responsiveness of the host 48 , and stimulates the immune system  10]. moreover, disruption of the gut microbiota 49 composition by antibiotic treatment, pesticide exposure, or dietary manipulations has 50 been associated with increased pathogen loads resulting in increased host mortality -51 14]. 52 a striking feature of the honey bee gut microbiota is its low taxonomic complexity. in 53 worker bees, the community is dominated by less than ten phylotypes (i.e. clusters of 54 strains sharing ≥97% sequence identity in the 16s rrna gene), which typically make up 55 >95% of the bacterial cells in the gut  15-18]. these phylotypes have been consistently 56 detected in honey bees, regardless of geographic location, life stage, or season  19, 20], 57 and are acquired horizontally through contact with nest mates and hive components . 58 they include five core phylotypes (gilliamella, snodgrassella, lactobacillus firm-4 and 59 firm-5, and bifidobacterium), which are typically present in every adult worker bee, and a 60 number of non-core phylotypes, e.g. frischella, bartonella, commensalibacter, or 61 bombella, which are prevalent across colonies, but not necessarily present in every bee 62 . additional phylotypes have been detected, including lactobacillus kunkeii, serratia page 4 of 44 marcescens and other enterobacteriaceae, or apibacter, but they typically account for a 64 relatively small proportion of the bee gut microbiota . 65 while many of these phylotypes are consistently present in adult worker bees, their 66 abundance can vary across bees, and may differentially impact the host physiology. 67 particularly, the type and amount of nutrients (i.e. pollen and nectar) available during the 68 foraging season can have profound effects on the composition of the gut microbiota and 69 may alter its metabolic activity . likewise, distinct dietary habits or variation in lifespan 70 of worker bees during summer and winter may influence gut microbiota composition. from 71 spring to autumn, young worker bees (nurses) stay inside the hive to take care of larvae, 72 and feed on nutrient-rich pollen, whereas older worker bees become foragers that feed on 73 nectar and honey to fuel their energy-expensive flights . in late autumn, newly emerged 74 adult worker bees become winter bees (also called 'diutinus') that have an extended 75 lifespan (~6 months) and that ensure the colony survival during the cold winter season in 76 the absence of brood . these bees form a tight cluster for thermoregulation inside the 77 hive, feed strictly on food stores (pollen, beebread, and honey) and retain their feces all 78 winter , which is likely to impact the ecology of their gut microbiota. 79 a number of studies have looked at the gut microbiota composition of different worker bee 80 types or throughout seasons, with the overall conclusion that the community composition 81 is relatively stable  28-31]. however, previous studies were mostly based on 82 comparative analyses of relative community member abundance using 16s rrna amplicon 83 sequencing. such analysis cannot provide insights about the extent or directionality of 84 changes in taxa abundance, especially if microbial loads vary substantially between 85 samples . in fact, a change in the total abundance of the microbiota could by itself be 86 .the single bee hive, each gut sample was placed in a drop of pbs, scored for the scab 132 phenotype , and placed in a bead beating tube containing ~150 mg of glass beads (0.75-133","Lucie Kešnerová, Olivier Emery, Michaël Troilo, Joanito Liberti, Berra Erkosar,
